  </div>
</div>

<p class='c002'>‘<em>Mrs. Hungerford has well deserved the title of being one of the most
fascinating novelists of the day. The stories written by her are the airiest,
lightest, and brightest imaginable, full of wit, spirit, and gaiety; but they contain,
nevertheless, touches of the most exquisite pathos. There is something
good in all of them.</em>’—<span class='sc'>Academy.</span></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MAIDEN ALL FORLORN</strong>, and other Stories. Post
8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no guile in the novels of the authoress of “Molly Bawn,” nor any
consistency or analysis of character; but they exhibit a faculty truly remarkable
for reproducing the rapid small-talk, the shallow but harmless “chaff” of certain
strata of modern fashionable society.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>IN DURANCE VILE</strong>, and other Stories. Post 8vo.,
illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford’s Irish girls have always been pleasant to meet upon the
dusty pathways of fiction. They are flippant, no doubt, and often sentimental,
and they certainly flirt, and their stories are told often in rather ornamental
phrase and with a profusion of the first person singular. But they are charming
all the same.’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MENTAL STRUGGLE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards,
2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She can invent an interesting story, she can tell it well, and she trusts to
honest, natural, human emotions and interests of life for her materials.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>A MODERN CIRCE.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.;
cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is a distinctly amusing author.... In all her books there
is a “healthy absenteeism” of ethical purpose, and we have derived more genuine
pleasure from them than probably the most earnest student has ever obtained
from a chapter of “Robert Elsmere.”’—<cite>Saturday Review.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>MARVEL.</strong> Post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The author has long since created an imaginary world, peopled with more or
less natural figures; but her many admirers acknowledge the easy grace and inexhaustible
<i><span lang="fr">verve</span></i> that characterize her scenes of Hibernian life, and never tire of
the type of national heroine she has made her own.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>LADY VERNER’S FLIGHT.</strong> Crown 8vo., cloth extra,
3s. 6d.; post 8vo., illustrated boards, 2s.; cloth limp, 2s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There are in “Lady Verner’s Flight” several of the bright young people who
are wont to make Mrs. Hungerford’s books such very pleasant reading.... In
all the novels by the author of “Molly Bawn” there is a breezy freshness of treatment
which makes them most agreeable.’—<cite>Spectator.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE RED-HOUSE MYSTERY.</strong> Crown 8vo., cloth
extra, 3s. 6d.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Hungerford is never seen to the best advantage when not dealing with
the brighter sides of life, or seeming to enjoy as much as her readers the ready
sallies and laughing jests of her youthful personages. In her present novel, however,
the heroine, if not all smiles and mirth, is quite as taking as her many predecessors,
while the spirit of uncontrolled mischief is typified in the American
heiress.’—<cite>Morning Post.</cite></p>

<p class='c003'><strong>THE THREE GRACES.</strong> 2 vols., crown 8vo., 10s. net.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is impossible to deny that Mrs. Hungerford is capable of writing a charming
love-story, and that she proves her capacity to do so in “The Three Graces.”’—<cite>Academy.</cite></p>

  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>‘Confidence imparts a wondrous inspiration to its
possessor. It bears him on in security, either to meet
no danger or to find matter of glorious trial.’</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl seems powerfully affected by the
determination she has come to, so much so
as to be almost on the point of fainting.
Wyndham, catching her by the arm, presses
her back into the garden-chair.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a word,’ says he. ‘Why should you
tell me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I must, I will!’ She sits up, and with
marvellous strength of will recovers herself.
‘There is very little to tell,’ says she faintly.
‘I have lived all my life in one house. As a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>little child I came to it. Before that I
remember nothing. If’—she looks at him—‘I
tell you names and places, you will keep
them sacred? You will not betray me?’
Her glance is now at once wistful and
frightened.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall certainly not do that,’ says he
gravely. ‘But why speak if you need not?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know.’ She pauses, clasping her
hands tightly together, and then at last, ‘I
want to tell you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, tell me,’ says Wyndham gently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The name of the people I lived with was
Moore,’ says she, speaking at once and
rapidly, as if eager to get rid of what she
has volunteered to tell. ‘They called me
Moore, too—Ella Moore—though I know, I
am sure, I did not belong to them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ella?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, Ella; I think’—hesitatingly—‘that
is my real Christian name, because far, far
back someone’—pressing her hand to her head,
as though trying to remember—‘used to call
me Elly, someone who was not Mrs. Moore.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>It was not her voice. And Moore—that is
not my name, I know.’ Her tone has grown
quite firm. ‘Mrs. Moore always called herself
my aunt; but I don’t think she was
anything to me. She was kind sometimes,
however, and I was sorry when she died.
She had a husband, and I lived with them
ever since I can remember anything.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps you were Mr. Moore’s niece.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not that!’ She grows very pale, and
makes a quick gesture of repulsion with her
hands. ‘Not that. No, thank God!’ She
pauses, and he can see that she has begun to
tremble as if at some dreadful thought.
‘She, Mrs. Moore, died two months ago, and
after that he—she was hardly in her grave—and
he—Oh, it is horrible!’—burying
her face in her hands. ‘But he—he told me
he wanted to marry me.’ She struggles with
herself for a moment, and then bursts into
wild tears. One can see that the tears are
composed of past cruel memories, of outraged
pride as well as grief.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, monstrous!’ says Wyndham hurriedly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>He begins to pace rapidly up and down the
walk, coming back to her when he finds her
more composed.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is true, though,’ cries she miserably.
‘Oh, how I hate to think of it!’—emphatically.
‘When I said no, that I’d rather die
than marry him—and I would—he was
furious. A fortnight afterwards he spoke
to me again, saying he had ordered the
banns to be called; and when I again said
I would never consent, he locked me in a
room, and said he would starve me to death
unless I gave in. I’—clenching her small
white teeth—‘told him I would gladly starve
in preference to that. And for three nights
and two days I did starve. He brought me
nothing; but I did not see him, and that kept
me alive. On the third day he came again,
and again I defied him, and then—then—’
She cowers away from Wyndham, and the
hot flush of shame dyes her cheek. ‘Then—he
beat me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The — scoundrel!’ says Wyndham between
his teeth.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>‘He beat me,’ says the girl, dry sobs
breaking from her lips, ‘until my back and
arms were blue and swollen; and then he
asked me again if I would give in and marry
him, and I—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here she pauses, and stands back as if
confronting someone. She is looking past
Wyndham and far into space. It is plain
that that past horrible, degrading scene has
come back to her afresh. The gross indignity,
the abominable affront, is again a present
thing. Again the blows rain upon her
slender arms and shoulders; again the brute
is demanding her submission; and again, in
spite of hunger, and pain, and fear, she is
defying him. Her head is well upheld, her
hands clenched, her large eyes ablaze. It is
thus she must have looked as she defied the
cowardly scoundrel, and the effect is magnificent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I said “No” again.’ The fire born of
that last conflict dies away, and she falls
back weakly into the seat behind her. ‘That
night I ran away. I suppose in his rage he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>forgot to lock the door after him, and so
I found the matter easy. It was a wet night
and very cold. I was tired, half dead with
hunger and with bitter pain. That was the
night—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She comes to a dead stop here, and turns
her face away from him. A shame keener
than any she has known before, even in this
recital made to him, is filling her now. But
still she determines to go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That was the night your servant found
me!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor child!’ says Wyndham. His sympathy—so
unexpected—coming on her terrible
agitation, breaks her down. She bursts into
a storm of sobs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I would to God,’ says she, ‘that I had
died before he found me! Yes—yes, I would,
though I know it was His will, and His
alone, that kept me alive, half dead from
cold and hunger as I was. I can’t bear to
think of that night, and what you must
have thought of me! It was dreadful—dreadful!
You shrank from me because I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>courted death so openly. Yes—yes, you did’—combating
a gesture on his part—‘but you
did not know how near I was to it at that
moment. I was famished, bruised, homeless—I
was almost senseless. I knew only that
I could not return to that man’s house, and
that there was no other house to go to.
That was all I knew, through the unconsciousness
that was fast overtaking me. To
die seemed the best thing—and to die in
that warm room. I was frozen. Oh, blame
me, despise me, if you like, but anyone
would have been glad to die, if they felt
as homeless and as starving as I did that
night!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who is blaming you?’ says Wyndham
roughly. ‘Good heavens! is there a man on
earth who could blame you, after hearing so
sad a story? Because you have met one
brute in your life, must you consider all other
men brutes?’</p>

<p class='c004'>His manner is so vehement that Ella,
thinking he is annoyed with her, shrinks
from him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>‘Don’t be angry with me,’ says she imploringly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Angry with you!’ says he impatiently.
‘There is only one to be angry with, and
that is that devil. Where does he live?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She gives him the road, and the number of
the house where she had lived with the
Moores—a road of small houses, chiefly
occupied by artisans and clerks; a road not
very far from the Zoological Gardens.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But what are you going to do?’ asks she
nervously. ‘You will not tell him I am
here?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course not. But it is quite necessary
that a fellow like that should feel there is a
law in the land.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But if you say anything about me,’ says
she in a tone now thoroughly frightened, ‘he
will search me out, no matter in what corner
of the earth I may be.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think so, once I have spoken to
him,’ says the barrister grimly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mean’—she looks at him timidly—‘you
think that if—’ She breaks off
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>again. ‘He told me that his wife, who he
said was my aunt, had made him guardian
over me, and that he would be my master for
ever.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Even supposing all that were true, and
Mrs. Moore were your aunt—which I doubt—and
had left her husband guardian over
you, still, there are limits to the powers of
guardians.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then if you see him, you think’—with
trembling anxiety—‘you can tell him that
he has no hold over me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I think so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And I shall be free?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Quite free.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella leans forward. Her hands are upon
her knees and are tightly clenched. She is
thinking. Suddenly a soft glow overspreads
her face. She lifts her eyes to his, and he
can see that a wonderful brilliance—the light
of hope—has come into them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is too good to be true,’ says she
slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no, I hope not. But I wish I had a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>few more particulars, Miss Moore. I am
afraid’—seeing a shade upon her face—‘I
shall be obliged to call you that until I have
discovered your real name. And to do that
you must help me. Have you no memory
that goes farther back than the Moores?
You spoke of someone who used to call you
Elly—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was a woman,’ says she quickly. ‘Often—often
in my dreams I see her again. She
used to kiss me—I remember that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is such a sad little saying—once, long
ago, so long ago that she can scarcely remember
it, some woman used to kiss her!
But, evidently, since that tender kisses had
not fallen to the poor child’s lot.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But she died. I saw her lying dead. I
thought she was asleep. She was very
beautiful—I remember that, too. I don’t
want to see anyone dead again. Death,’
says she with a shudder, ‘is horrible!’</p>

<p class='c004'>This, coming from one who had braved
its terrors voluntarily so very lately, causes
Wyndham to look at her in some surprise.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>‘Yes!’ says he. ‘And yet that night
when the Professor gave you something that
might have led to death, were you frightened
then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think I have explained that,’ says she,
with a slight touch of dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True.’ He continues the slow pacing to
and fro upon the garden-path that he has
taken up occasionally during this interview.
‘There is nothing more, then, that you can
tell me? The lady of whom you speak, who
used to kiss you, was perhaps your mother?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think so—I believe it,’ says the girl.
She turns to him a face flushed and gratified.
‘Mr. Wyndham, it was kind of you to call
her that—a lady! To me, too, she seems a
lady, and, besides that, an angel.’</p>

<p class='c004'>A lady! Wyndham’s kindly instincts go
out to this poor waif and stray with an
extreme sense of pity. A lady! Very likely,
but perhaps no wife. The mother, if a lady,
has certainly left the gentle manners of good
birth to this poor child, but nothing else. A
vindictive anger against the vices of this life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>in which he lives, and a still greater anger
against the <i><span lang="fr">bétises</span></i> of society that would not
admit this girl into their ranks, however
faultless she may be, because of a blot upon
her birth, stirs his soul. That she is one of
the great unknown seems very clear to him,
but does not prevent his determination to
hunt out that scoundrel Moore and break his
hold over the girl. In the meantime, it
would be well for her to mix with her kind.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘About a companion,’ says he. ‘You told
me you were anxious to continue your studies.
I think I know a lady—elderly, refined,
and gentle—who would be able to help you.
You could go out with her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall not go out of this house,’ says the
girl. She has begun to tremble again.
‘Mr. Wyndham, do not ask me to do that.
Even’—slowly, but steadily—‘if you did ask
me, I should refuse. I will not go where
I can be found. This lady you speak of, if
she will come and live with me, and teach
me—I should like that; but—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will require very little teaching, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>think,’ says Wyndham, who has been struck
by the excellence of both her manners and
her speech, considering her account of her
former life.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know nothing,’ says she calmly; ‘but,
as I told you, I had read a good deal, and
for the past three years I used to go as
nursery governess to a Mrs. Blaquiere, who
lived in Westmoreland Road. I used to
lunch with her and the children, and she was
very kind to me; and she taught me a good
deal in other ways—society ways.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You were an apt pupil,’ says he gravely,
a little doubtfully, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I liked the way she talked, and it seemed
to come very easy to me after awhile,’ says
the girl indifferently, not noticing his keen
glance at her. ‘But this governess—this
companion?’ asks she. ‘Will she want to go
out—to be amused? If so, I could not have
her. I shall never go out of this place
until—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Until?’ asks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You tell me that man has no longer any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>power over me. I’—she looks at him, and
again terror whitens her face—‘I am sure
you are wrong, and that he has the power to
drag me away from this, if he finds me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should advise you not to dwell on that
until I have found him,’ says Wyndham, a
little stiffly. The successful barrister is a
little thrown back upon himself by being told
that he will undoubtedly find himself in the
wrong. ‘But this Mrs. Blaquiere, who was
so kind to you—why do you not apply to
her for protection?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She and her husband and the children all
went to Australia in the early part of last
spring, and so I lost sight of them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Lost your situation, too?’—regarding her
carefully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; and I had no time to look for
another. Mrs. Moore grew ill then, and I
had to attend her day and night until she
died. The rest I have told you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see,’ says Wyndham. ‘Tell me again
this man Moore’s address.’ He writes it now
in his pocket-book, though it was written
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>well into his brain before; but he wished to
see if she would falter about it the second
time.</p>

<p class='c004'>He bids her good-bye presently, refusing
her timid offer of tea.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the gate he finds Mrs. Denis, presumably
tying up a creeper, but most undoubtedly
on the look-out for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-evening, yer honour.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good-evening’—shortly. Wyndham is
deep in thought, and by no means in a good
temper. He would have brushed by her;
but, armed with a garden rake, a spade, and
a huge clipper, Mrs. Denis is not lightly to
be dealt with.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Askin’ yer pardon, sir, ’tis just a word
I want wid ye. Miss Ella, the crathure—ye’re
going to let her stay here, aren’t
ye?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Wyndham gruffly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The saints be praised!’ says Mrs. Denis
piously. ‘Fegs! ’tis a good heart ye have,
sir, in spite of it all.’ What the ‘all’ is she
leaves beautifully indefinite. ‘An’, sure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>’twas meself tould Denis—that ould raprobate
of a fool o’ mine—that ye’d niver turn her
out. “For where would she go,” says I, “if
he did—a born lady like her?” An’ there’s
plenty o’ room for her here, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I dare say,’ says Wyndham, feeling
furious. ‘But for all that, I can’t have
all the young women in Ireland staying in
my house just because there is room for
them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘God forbid, yer honour! All thim young
women would play the very divil wid the
Cottage, an’’—thoughtfully—‘aitch other
too. Wan at a time, sir, is a good plan, an’
I’m glad it’s Miss Ella has had the first
of it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This remarkable speech is met by Wyndham
with a stony glare that goes lightly over the
head of Mrs. Denis. That worthy woman is
too much elated with the news she has
dragged out of him to care for glares of any
sort. Childless, though always longing for a
child—and especially for a daughter—Mrs.
Denis’s heart had gone out at once to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>pretty waif that had been cast into her life in
so strange a fashion. And now she hastens
back to the house to get ‘her Miss Ella a cup
o’ tay, the crathure!’ and wheedle out of her
all the news about the ‘masther.’</p>

<p class='c009'>‘Tell me how to bear so blandly the assuming ways
of wild young people!</p>

<p class='c002'>‘Truly they would be unbearable if I had not also
been unbearable myself as well.’—<span class='sc'>Goethe.</span></p>

<p class='c010'>When Mr. Crosby had told the Barrys that
he would come down next day for a game
of tennis, they had not altogether believed
in his coming, so that when they see him
from afar off, through the many holes in the
hedge, walking towards them down the
village street, surprise is their greatest sentiment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Dominick solemnly, pausing
racket in hand, ‘it must be you. I always
told you your face was your fortune, and a
very small one at that. You’ll have to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>marry him, and then we’ll all go and live
with you for ever. That’ll be a treat for
you, and will doubtless make up for the fact
that he is emulating the Great Methuselah.
If I can say a good word for you, I—Oh,
how d’ye do, Mr. Crosby? Brought
your racket, too, I see. Carew, now we’ll
make up a set: Mr. Crosby and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Miss Susan, if I may,’ says Crosby, looking
into Susan’s charming face whilst holding
her hand in greeting. There are any
amount of greetings to be got through when
you go to see the Barrys. They are all
always <i><span lang="fr">en évidence</span></i>, and all full of life and
friendliness. Even little Bonnie hurries up
on his stick, and gives him a loving greeting.
The child’s face is so sweet and so happily
friendly that Crosby stoops and kisses him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly you may,’ says Susan genially;
‘but I’m not so good a player as Betty.
She can play like anything. But to-day
she has got a bad cold in her head. Well’—laughing—‘come
on; we can try, and,
after all, we can only be beaten.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>They are, as it happens, and very badly,
too, Mr. Crosby, though no doubt good at
big game, being rather a tyro at tennis.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I apologize,’ says he, when the game is
at an end, and they have all seated themselves
upon the ground to rest and gather
breath; ‘I’m afraid Su—Miss Susan—you
will hardly care to play with me again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I told you you could call me Susan,’ says
she calmly. ‘Somehow, I dislike the Miss
before it. Betty told you Miss Barry
sounded like Aunt Jemima, but I think
Miss Susan sounds like Jane.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor old Jane! And she’s got such an
awful nose!’ says Betty. ‘I think I’d rather
be like Aunt Jemima than her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan hasn’t got an awful nose,’ says
Bonnie, stroking Susan’s dainty little Grecian
appendage fondly. ‘It’s a nice one.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan is a beauty,’ says Betty; ‘we all
know that. Even James went down before
her. Poor James! I wonder what he is
doing now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stewing in the Soudan,’ says Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>‘He was always in one sort of stew or
another,’ says Dominick, ‘so it will come
kindly to him. And after Susan’s heartless
behaviour—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dom!’ says Susan, in an awful tone.
But Mr. Fitzgerald is beyond the reach of
tones.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it’s all very well your taking it like
that now,’ says he; ‘but when poor old
James was here it was a different thing.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was not,’ says Susan indignantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you going to deny that he was your
abject slave—that he sat in your pocket
from morning till night—well, very nearly
night? That he followed you from place to
place like a baa-lamb? That you did not
encourage him in the basest fashion?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I never encouraged him. Encourage
him! That boy!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t call him names, Susan, behind his
back,’ says Betty, whose mischievous nature
is now all afire, and who is as keen about
the baiting of Susan as either Carew or
Dom. ‘Besides, what a boy he is! He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>must be twenty-two, at all events.’ This
seems quite old to Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What did you do with the keepsake he
gave you when he was going away?’ asks
Carew. He is lying flat upon the warm
grass, his chin upon his palms, and looks up
at Susan with judicial eyes. ‘What was it?
I forget now. A lock of his lovely hair?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Betty; ‘a little silver brooch—an
anchor.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That means hope,’ says Dominick solemnly.
‘Susan, he is coming back next year. What
are you going to say to him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just exactly what everybody else is
going to say to him,’ says Susan, who is now
crimson. ‘And I didn’t want that horrid
brooch at all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, you took it,’ says Betty. ‘I call
that rather mean, to take it, and then say
you didn’t want it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, what was I to do?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Refuse it, mildly but firmly,’ says Mr.
Fitzgerald. ‘The acceptance of it was, in
my opinion, as good as the acceptance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>James. When he does come back, Susan,
I don’t see how you are to get out of being
Mrs. James. That brooch is a regular
binder. How does it seem to you, Mr.
Crosby?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You see, I haven’t heard all the evidence
yet,’ says Crosby, who is looking at Susan’s
flushed, half-angry, wholly-delightful face.
James, whoever he is, seems to have been
a good deal in her society at one time.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There’s no evidence,’ says she wrathfully,
‘and I wish you boys wouldn’t be so stupid!
As for the brooch, I hate it; I never
wear it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, if ever anyone gives me a present
I shall wear it every day and all day long,’
says Betty. ‘What’s the good of having a
lover if people don’t know about it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that so?’ says Mr. Fitzgerald, regarding
her with all the air of one to whom now
the road seems clear. ‘Then the moment I
become a millionaire—and there seems quite
an immediate prospect of it just now—I
shall buy you the Koh-i-Noor, and you shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>wear it on your beauteous brow, and proclaim
me as your unworthy lover to all the world.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I will when I get it,’ says Betty, with
tremendous sarcasm.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The reason you won’t wear it,’ says
Carew, alluding to Susan’s despised brooch,
‘is plain to even the poor innocents around
you. Girls, in spite of all Betty has said,
seldom wear their keepsakes. They get
cotton wool and wrap them up in it, and
peep at them rapturously on Christmas Day
or Easter Sunday, or on the beloved one’s
birthday, or some other sacred occasion.
What’s James’s birthday, Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know,’ says Susan; ‘and I don’t
know, either, why you tease me so much
about him. He is quite as little to me as
I am to him.’ Her voice is trembling now.
They have gone a little too far perhaps, or
is the memory of James ‘stewing in the
Soudan’ too much for her? Whichever it
is, Mr. Crosby is growing anxious for her;
but all the youngsters are now in full cry,
and the proverbial cruelty of brothers and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>sisters is well known to many a long-suffering
girl and boy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Susan,’ says Betty, ‘where does one
go to when one tells naughty-naughties?
Dom; do you remember the evening just
before James went abroad, when he went
into floods of tears because she wouldn’t give
him a rosebud she had in her dress? It
took Dom, and me, and Carew, and a pint of
water to restore him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this they all laugh, even Susan, though
very faintly and very shamefacedly. Her
pretty eyes are shy and angry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He wanted a specimen to take out with
him to astonish the natives,’ says Carew.
‘You were the real specimen he wanted to
take out with him, Susan, but as that was
impracticable just then (it will probably be
arranged next time), he decided on taking
the rosebud instead.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He wanted nothing,’ says Susan, whose
face is now bent over Bonnie’s as if to hide
it. ‘He didn’t care a bit about me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Indeed he did, Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>A fresh element has fallen into the situation.
Everyone looks round. The voice is
the voice of Jacky—Jacky, who, up to this,
has been as usual buried in a book. This
time the burial has been deeper than ever,
as the day before yesterday someone had lent
him Mr. Stevenson’s enthralling ‘Treasure
Island,’ from which no one can ever extract
themselves until the very last page is turned.
Jacky, since he first began it, has been
practically useless, but just now a few
fragments of the conversation going on
around him have filtered to his brain.</p>

<p class='c004'>Now, in his own peculiarly disagreeable
way he adores Susan, and something has led
him to believe that those around her are
now depreciating her powers of attraction,
and that she is giving in to them for want
of support. Well, he will support her. Poor
old Jacky! he comes nobly forward to her
rescue, and as usual puts his foot in it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He liked you better than anyone,’ says
he, in his slow, ponderous fashion, glaring
angrily at Betty, with whom he carries on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>an undying feud. ‘Why, don’t you remember
how he used to hunt you all over
the garden to kiss you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Tableau!</p>

<p class='c004'>Betty leads the way after about a
moment’s awful pause, and then they all go
off into shrieks of laughter. Jacky, alone,
sullen, silent, not understanding, stands as
if petrified. Susan has pushed Bonnie from
her, and has risen to her feet. Her face is
crimson now; her eyes are full of tears.
Involuntarily Crosby rises too.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He used not,’ says poor Susan. Alas!
this assertion is not quite true. ‘And even
if he did, you’—to the horrified Jacky—‘should
not have told it. You, Jacky’—trembling
with shame—‘I wouldn’t have
believed it of you! It was hateful of you!
You’—with a withering glance around—‘are
all hateful, and—and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She chokes, breaks down, and runs with
swift-flying feet into the small shrubbery
beyond, where lies a little summer-house in
which she can hide herself.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>‘Tears are often to be found where there is little
sorrow.’</p>

<p class='c010'>An embarrassed silence falls upon the group
she leaves behind her. It had not occurred
to them that she would care so much. They
had often chaffed her before. It must—it
must have been Mr. Crosby’s being there
that had put her out like that. To tell the
truth, they are all penitent—Betty perhaps
more than the others. But even her remorse
sinks into insignificance before Jacky’s. His
takes the nature of a wrathful attack upon
the others, and ends in a storm of tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’ve been teasing her, you know you
have—and she’s mad with me now. And I
didn’t mean anything. And she’s crying, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>know she is. And you’re all beasts—beasts!’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is at this point that his own tears break
forth, and, like Susan, he flees from them—but,
unlike Susan, howling.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I didn’t know; I didn’t think she’d care,’
says Betty, in a frightened tone. ‘We often
teased her before;’ and she might have said
more, but an attack of sneezing lays her low.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But before a stranger!’ says Carew
anxiously. ‘I am afraid, Mr. Crosby, it is
because you were here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It isn’t a bit like Susan to care like that,’
says Dom. ‘I say’—contritely—‘I’m awfully
sorry. I wonder where she is, Betty.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In the summer-house. She always goes
there when she’s vexed or worried.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why don’t you go to her, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I can’t. I’ve a cold. I’ll wait awhile,’
says Betty, holding back.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think, as it has been my fault,’ says
Crosby quietly, ‘that I had better be the
one to apologize. Where is this summer-house
of which you speak?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>‘Right round there,’ says Betty eagerly,
pointing to the corner of the house.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just behind the rose-trees,’ says Dom,
giving him a friendly push forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can’t miss her,’ says Carew, who is
dying to give him an encouraging clap on
the shoulder. They are all evidently very
anxious to get the task of ‘making it up’
with Susan on to any other shoulders than
their own.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I think I’ll take a little hostage
with me, or shall we say a peace-offering?’
says Crosby, catching up Bonnie, and starting
with him for Susan’s hiding-place. ‘Any way,
I’ve got a pioneer,’ says he. ‘He’ll show me
the way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The way is short and very sweet. Along
a gravelled pathway, between trees of glowing
roses, to where in the distance is a tiny
house, made evidently by young, untutored
hands, out of young and very unseasoned
timber.</p>

<p class='c004'>A slender figure is inside it—a figure
flung miserably into one of the corners, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>crying perhaps, after all, more angrily than
painfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, what on earth are you doing that
for?’ says Crosby. He seats himself on the
rustic bench beside her, and places Bonnie on
her knee. It seems to him that that will
be the best way to bring down her hands
from her eyes. And he is not altogether
wrong. It is impossible to let her little
beloved one fall off her knees, so quickly,
if reluctantly, she brings down her right
hand so as to clasp him securely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What are you crying about?’ goes on
Crosby, very proud of the success of his
first manœuvre. ‘Because somebody wanted
to kiss you? You will have a good deal of
crying at that rate, Susan, before you come
to the end of your life.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He is laughing a little now, and as Bonnie
has climbed up on her knees, and is pulling
away the other hand from her face, Susan
feels she may as well make the best of a
bad situation.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It wasn’t so much that,’ says she.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>‘Though’—anxiously—‘Jacky exaggerated
most dreadfully. As to my objecting to
their teasing me about James McIlveagh—you
have not seen him, or you would understand
me better. It is not only that he is
uninteresting, but that he is awful! His
nose is like an elephant’s trunk, and his
eyes are as small as the head of a pin. And
his clothes—his trousers—I don’t know where
he got his trousers, but Dom used to say his
mother made them in her spare moments.
Not that one would care about a person’s
trousers, of course,’ says Susan, with intense
earnestness, ‘if he was nice himself; but
James wasn’t nice, and I was never more
glad in my life than when he went away.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s coming back, however.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I know, and I’m sorry for it, if they
are going to tease me all day long about him,
as they are doing now. I think’—with a
hasty glance at him, born of the fact that
she knows her eyes are disfigured by crying—‘you
might have tried to stop them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, you see, I hardly knew what to do
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>at first,’ says Crosby, quite entering into the
argument. ‘And when I did, it was a little
too late. Of course it seemed to me a very
possible thing that you might have given
your heart to this young man with the nose
and the unfortunate trousers who is stewing
in the Soudan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You might have known by my manner
that I hated them to tease me about him,’
says Susan, very little appeased by his
apology.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll know better next time,’ says Crosby
humbly. ‘But when I heard he had been
following you about like a baa-lamb, and
that you had taken that anchor from him,
and that he used to—’</p>

<p class='c004'>He is checked by a flash from Susan’s eyes.
There is a pause. Then suddenly she presses
her face into Bonnie’s flaxen hair, and bursts
into smothered laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I don’t care! He did once, all
round the gooseberry bushes; and I threw a
spade at him, and it hit him on the head,
and I thought I had killed him. I’—with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>another glance at Crosby, now from between
Bonnie’s curls—‘was dreadfully frightened
then. But now I almost wish I had. Any
way, he never tried to—he never, I mean’—confusedly—‘hunted
me again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I begin to feel sincerely sorry for James,’
says Crosby. ‘He seems to me to have led
but a sorry life before he started for the
Soudan. When he comes home next year,
what will you do? He may be quite’—he
looks at her and smiles—‘a mighty hunter
by that time.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan laughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Like you,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby looks at her. It is a ready answer,
and with another might convey a certain
meaning, but with Susan never.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, I’m afraid of gooseberry bushes,’ says
he. ‘They have thorns in them. James,
you see, surpasses me in valour. Talking
of valour reminds me of those you have left
behind you, and who have sent me here as
their plenipotentiary, to extract from you a
promise of peace. They are all very sorry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>they annoyed you so much about the redoubtable
James; and they desired me to
say so. I was afraid to come by myself, so
I brought Bonnie with me. Bonnie, tell her
to come back with me now, and say: “Peace
is restored with honour.” Say it for her,
Bonnie.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“Peace is restored with honour,”’ repeats
Bonnie sweetly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There, that settles it,’ says Crosby. ‘He
knows his lesson. So do you; come back
and forgive us all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I can’t,’ says Susan. ‘They would
know I had been crying. Look at my eyes;
they are quite red.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They are not, indeed,’ says Mr. Crosby,
after an exhaustive examination. ‘They are
quite blue.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes, that, of course’—impatiently.
‘But, well—really, how are they?’ She
leans towards him, and gazes at him out of
the blue eyes with an extraordinary calm.
‘Would they know I had been crying?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They would not,’ says Crosby. ‘It is I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>alone who am in that secret. And, by the
way, Susan’—stopping her as they both
rise—‘that is the second secret we have between
us; we are becoming quite fashionable—we
are growing into a society, you
and I.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish you would forget that first secret,’
says Susan, blushing a little. ‘And, anyhow,
I hope you won’t tell the others that you
found me—you know—crying.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that makes me remember our first
secret,’ says Crosby. ‘You know that on
that never-to-be-forgotten memorable occasion
you said you trusted me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did I?’ Susan is blushing furiously now.
‘How can I recollect all the silly things I
said then? I have forgotten them all—and
I’m sure you have, too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not one of them,’ says Crosby. ‘They
are now classed with my most priceless
memories. “Go and steal no more,” you
said—and I haven’t up to this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan laughs in spite of herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, at all events I can trust you, then,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>not to betray me to them.’ She points to
the late temple of her tears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can trust me for that or anything
else in the wide world,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>He takes up Bonnie again, and they go
slowly back to the others.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>As Susan appears, the guilty ones upon the
tennis-ground move simultaneously towards
her, Betty with a shy little rush, and holding
out to her her racket.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Come and have another game, Susan, and
you, too, Mr. Crosby.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, do,’ says Carew. ‘Tea will be here
in a moment.’ He evidently holds this out
as an inducement to Crosby to remain. Mr.
Fitzgerald nobly backs him up.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Also Aunt Jemima!’ he says enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c004'>This joke, if it is meant for one, is a dead
failure. No one even smiles. Susan, who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>feeling a little shy, and is horribly conscious
that, in spite of Crosby’s assurances, her eyes
are of a very tell-tale colour, is fighting with
her brain for some light, airy, amusing remark
that may prove to all present that she had
only run away from them in mere search of
physical exercise, when suddenly the rather
forced smile dies upon her lips, and her eyes
become fixed on some object over there on
her right.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is it, Susan—a ghost?’ asks Dom,
who is equal to most occasions.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Susan, in a low voice. ‘But—this
is the third time. And look over there,
at that sycamore-tree in the Cottage garden.
Do you see anything?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘See what? “Is there visions about?”
asks Dom. ‘Really, Susan, you ought to
consider our nerves. Is it the “Bogie Man,”
or—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is a girl,’ says Susan. ‘There, there
again! Her face is between those two big
branches. Mr. Crosby’—eagerly—‘don’t
you see her?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>‘I do,’ cries Carew suddenly. ‘Oh, what
a lovely face!’</p>

<p class='c004'>It may be remembered that the Rectory
and the Cottage are only divided by a narrow
road and two high walls. At the farthest
end of the Cottage grounds some tall trees
are standing—a beech, two elms, and a
sycamore. All these uprear themselves well
above the walls, and cast their shadows in
summer, and their leaves in winter, down on
the road beneath. They can be distinctly
seen from the Rectory tennis-court, and,
indeed, add a good deal of charm to it, the
road being so narrow, and the walls so much
of a height, that strangers often think the
trees on the Cottage lawn are actually belonging
to the Rectory.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I see too,’ says Crosby, leaning
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes!’ cries Betty. ‘But is it a
girl?’</p>

<p class='c004'>And now a little silence falls upon them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Over there, peeping out between the leaves
of the soft sycamore-tree, is a face. There is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>nothing to tell if it be a boy’s or a girl’s face,
as nothing can be seen but the shapely head;
and its soft abundant tresses of chestnut
hair are so closely drawn back into a knot
behind that they are hidden by the crowding
branches. The eyes are gleaming, the lips
slightly parted. So might a Hamadryad
look, peering through swaying leaves.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s the prisoner,’ says Jacky, in an awestruck
tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The apparition, you mean,’ corrects Mr.
Fitzgerald severely. ‘Prisoners, as a rule,
have bodies, spooks have none. Jacky, you
lucky creature, you have seen a ghost.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is it a boy or a girl?’ asks Betty in an
anxious tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A most pertinent question?’ says Fitzgerald,
who is taking the situation with anything
but the seriousness that is so evidently
demanded of it. ‘But, as I have before
remarked, there is no body to go by, and
naturally no clothes. It is therefore unanswerable.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby has said nothing. He is, indeed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>deeply occupied with the face. So this is
Wyndham’s tenant. A very lovely one.</p>

<p class='c004'>Again a slight doubt arises in his mind
about his friend. And yet Wyndham had
seemed thoroughly honest in his explanation.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know it’s a girl,’ says Susan, with
decision. ‘Jacky has seen her; and what
a pretty one! Oh, there, she’s gone!’ And,
indeed, the Hamadryad, as if becoming
suddenly conscious of the fact that they
are looking at her, draws back her head
and disappears. ‘I’m afraid she saw us,’ says
Susan contritely. ‘She must have thought
us very rude. I’ll ask father to let me call
on her, I think. She must be very lonely
there. And even if she is only Mrs.
Moriarty’s niece, still, she must have been
educated to make her look like that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps,’ says Crosby, speaking with
apparent carelessness, and looking direct
at Susan, ‘she might not like to be called
upon. I have been given to understand
that she is not a niece of Mrs. Moriarty’s,
and—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>‘No, but what, then?’ asks Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A tenant of Mr. Wyndham’s. He is a
friend of mine, you know; and he told me
lately he had grown very tired of the
Cottage, and was willing to take a tenant
for it. This lady is, I presume, the tenant.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The more reason why we should call upon
her,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But isn’t she very young,’ says Betty, ‘to
be a tenant all by herself?’</p>

<p class='c004'>This startling suggestion creates a slight
pause.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To be young is not to be beyond misfortune,’
says Crosby at last, in a grave
and very general tone. ‘No doubt this
young lady has lost her father and mother,
and is obliged to—er—do without them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is distinctly lame.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor thing!’ says Susan sympathetically.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We might ask her over here sometimes,’
says Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But if she has lost her parents lately,’
puts in Crosby hastily, ‘she might, perhaps—one
should not even with the best intentions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>force one’s self upon people in such deep
grief as hers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She wasn’t in mourning, any way,’ says
Betty, who can always tell you to a pin
what anyone is wearing; ‘she had a little
blue bow near her neck.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby recovers from this blow with difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At all events,’ says he, ‘I have heard
through Wyndham that she desires privacy
at present. No doubt when she feels equal
to receiving visitors she will let us all know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No doubt,’ says Dominick, who has been
studying Mr. Crosby closely, and with covert
amusement.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll ask Mr. Wyndham about her,’ says
Susan. ‘I think she would be happier if she
could tell about her sorrow. One should be
roused from one’s griefs, father says. And
even if out of mourning—I didn’t see any blue
bow, Betty—still, I am sure she must be sad
at heart.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, consult your father about it,’ says
Crosby, as a last resource. In spite of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>affection for Wyndham, he has doubts about
his tenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>At this point Jane appears, bringing a
tray, on which are cups and saucers, teapot
and  cream ewer, some bread-and-butter and
sponge-cake. Susan had spent the morning
making the sponge-cake on the chance of
Mr. Crosby’s coming. They had decided in
conclave that it would be better to have tea
out here on the pleasant grass (though there
is no table on which to put the tray) rather
than in the small and rather stuffy drawing-room.
They had had a distinct fight over it
with Miss Barry; but Dominick, who can
succeed in anything but his exams, overcame
her, and carried the day.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Put the tray down here,’ says Betty, with
quite an air, seeing that Susan has given way
a little beneath the want of the table—‘down
here on the grass near me. I’ll pour out the
tea’—this with a withering glance at Susan,
who is slightly flushed, and apparently
ashamed of herself. ‘We haven’t any rustic
table yet, Mr. Crosby,’ says Betty, with immense
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>aplomb, ‘but were going to have one
shortly’—this with all the admirable assurance
of a fashionable dame who has just
been ordering a garden tea-table from one of
the best London houses. She nods and smiles
at him. ‘Dom is going to make it. Susan’—with
a freezing glance at that damsel—‘do
you think you could manage to cut the
sponge-cake?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Cut it!’ says Jacky, who is sharp to see
that the idolized Susan is being sat upon, and
who still feels that he owes her reparation of
some sort. ‘Why couldn’t she cut it? She
made it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan bursts out laughing. It is too much,
and they all follow suit.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What! you made it?’ cries Crosby, taking
up a knife and beginning a vigorous attack
upon it. ‘Why didn’t you make it bigger
when you were about it? The fact that it is
your handiwork has, judging by myself, made
us all frightfully hungry. Thank Heaven,
there is still bread-and-butter, or I don’t
know what would become of us.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>They are all laughing still—indeed, their
merriment has quite reached a height—when
Susan, looking over her shoulder, nearly
drops her cup and saucer, and sits up as if
listening.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Someone is coming,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Aunt Jemima,’ indignantly declares Betty,
who is sitting up too.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tramp, tramp, tramp comes a foot along
the gravel path that skirts the side of the
house away from them. Tramp, tramp;
evidently two of the heaviest feet in Christendom
are approaching.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You’re right,’ whispers Dom; ‘’tis “the fa’
o’ her fairy feet.” Aunt Jemima, to a moral.’</p>

<p class='c004'>And Aunt Jemima it is, sweeping round
the house with her head well up, and the
desire to impress, that they all know so
fatally well, full upon her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t stir, Mr. Crosby; I really beg you
won’t. This is a rather <i><span lang="es">al-fresco</span></i> entertainment,
but I know you will excuse these wild
children.’ Here the wild children gave way
silently, convulsively.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>‘It is the most charming entertainment I
have been at for years,’ says Crosby pleasantly.
‘Where will you sit? Here?’ He is quite
assiduous in his attentions, especially about
the rug on which she is to sit—not his rug,
at all events; Susan has half of that.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you,’ says Miss Barry, ‘but I need
not trouble you; I do not intend to stay. I
merely came out to see if these remarkably
ill-mannered young people were taking care of
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>She speaks with a stiff and laboured smile
upon her lips, but an evident determination
to be amiable at all risks.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Won’t you have a cup of tea, Aunt
Jemima?’ asks Susan timidly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, thank you, my love. Pray don’t
trouble about me.  I’—with a crushing
glance at poor Susan—‘have no desire whatever
to interfere with your amusement. I
hope’—turning to Crosby—‘later on I may
be able to see more of you, but to-day I am
specially busy. I have many worries, Mr.
Crosby, that are not exactly on the surface.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>‘Like us all,’ says Crosby, nodding his
head gravely. ‘Life is full of thorns.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah!’ says Miss Barry. She feels that she
has now ‘impressed’ him indeed, and is
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We travel a thorny road,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby sadly acquiesces.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Adieu,’ says she. She makes him an old-fashioned
obeisance, and once again rounds
the corner and disappears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think it was very nice of you to
make fun of her,’ says Susan reproachfully to
Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fun of her! What do you take me for?’
says he. ‘Make fun of your aunt because I
said life was full of thorns? Well’—with
argument looming in his eye—‘isn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thorns?’ She pauses, as if wondering.
‘Oh no,’ says she. It seems a pity to disturb
so sweet a faith; and Crosby, with a
renunciatory wave of his hand, gives up the
impending argument.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Awful lucky she went away so soon!’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>Carew, as the last bit of Aunt Jemima’s tail
disappears round the corner. ‘She’d have
led us a life had she stayed. She’s been
on the prance all day on account of those
Brians.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, isn’t it awful?’ says Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who are the Brians?’ asks Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Farmers up on the hill over there’—pointing
far away to the south. ‘Very well-to-do
people, you know, with their sons going into
the Church, and their daughters at a first-class
school in Birmingham. Aunt Jemima,
thinking to help them on their road to civilization,
sent them a bath—one of the round
flat ones, you know—as a present last month,
hearing that they were expecting the girls
home for their holidays, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Betty breaks off, and goes into what
she calls ‘kinks’ of laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’ says Crosby, naturally desirous of
knowing where the laugh comes in.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that’s it!’ says Dom. ‘Really, Betty,
I think you might hold on long enough to
finish your own story. It appears Aunt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Jemima went up to the farm yesterday, and
found that they had taken the bath as an
ornament, and had nailed it up against the
sitting-room wall with four long tenpenny
nails, and—’ Here, in spite of his lecture
to Betty, Mr. Fitzgerald himself gives way,
and, falling back upon the grass, shouts with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They took it,’ gasps Carew, ‘as some
curio from some barbarous country—a sort of
shield, you know; a savage weapon! They
had never seen a bath before. Oh my!’
He, too, has gone into an ecstasy of mirth.
‘I expect they thought it was straight from
South Africa.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor Aunt Jemima!’ says Betty, when
she can speak. ‘It must have been a blow
to her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Talking of blows,’ says Carew, turning to
her sharply, and somewhat indignantly, ‘I
never knew anyone blow their nose like you,
Betty; you’ve been at it now since early
dawn.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I can’t help it,’ says Betty, very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>rightly aggrieved, ‘if I have got a cold in my
head.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ve a cold, too,’ says Jacky dismally—Jacky
is always dismal—‘but it isn’t as bad
as Betty’s. My head is aching, but Betty’s
nose is only running.’</p>

<p class='c004'>A frightful silence follows upon this terrific
speech. Mr. Fitzgerald, who can always be
depended upon at a crisis, breaks it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not far, I trust,’ says he, with exaggerated
anxiety. ‘We could hardly spare it. Betty’s
nose is the one presentable member of that
sort in the family.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Betty, between the pauses of this speech,
can be heard threatening Jacky. ‘No, no;
never! I won’t give it now. You’re a little
wretch! Even if I promised to give it I
don’t care. I’ll take it back. You shan’t
have it now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>But all this is so distinctly not meant to be
heard that no one takes any notice of it, and
any serious consequences are prevented by
the fact that Dominick, rising, throws himself
between the puzzled Jacky and the irate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>Betty. In the meantime, Crosby draws himself
along the rug until he is even closer
to Susan, who now again is looking serious.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is troubling you, righteous soul?’
asks he lightly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How do you know I am troubled? I am
not, really.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yet you are thinking, and very gravely,
too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, that is another thing. I was thinking,’
says Susan gently, ‘of the girl in there’—nodding
towards the Cottage. ‘It must be
a very sad thing to have no one belonging to
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Sad indeed! But you must not let your
sympathy for her run too far afield. If not
a father or mother, she must have—other
ties.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Brothers, you mean, or sisters?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, just so—brothers or sisters. They’ll
turn up presently, no doubt.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He looks at her as if waiting for an inspiration,
and then it comes to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a sympathetic mind you have!’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>he. ‘And yet you don’t give me a share of
it. You have known me quite a long time
now, and I have no father or mother, yet
you have not wept with me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I didn’t know,’ says Susan. ‘And, besides,
there was no long time, surely. Father told
us you had no father or mother, but—have
you’—with hesitation—‘no people belonging
to you, Mr. Crosby?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One sister,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One sister! And why doesn’t she live
with you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, you must ask her that. Perhaps she
wouldn’t care about it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should think she would love to live with
you,’ says Susan. She utters this bold sentiment
calmly, kindly, without so much as a
blink of her long lashes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby looks at her. Is she real, this
pretty child? His inclination to laugh dies
within him; and so dies, too, the inclination
to utter the usual society speech, that with
most society girls would have been considered
the thing on an occasion like this. Both are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>done to death by Susan’s eyes, so calm, so
sweet, so earnest, and so entirely without
a second meaning of any sort.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, you see, she doesn’t,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But why?’ asks Susan. She is feeling
a little angry with the unknown sister. To
live with Carew, if he were well off enough
to have her, would, Susan thinks, be a most
delightful arrangement.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seems she prefers to live with another
fellow,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan stares at him. He nods back at
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Fact,’ says he. ‘Horrid taste on her
part, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I see,’ says Susan slowly. ‘She’s
married.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very much,’ says Crosby. ‘At all events,
her husband is. She doesn’t give him much
rope. However, you’ll see her soon, as she is
coming to stay with me. She always makes
a point of coming to me for my birthday,
whenever I chance to be in Ireland or England
for it. I suppose I must be going now. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>say, you two fellows’—turning to Carew and
Dom—‘why are you so lazy? Why don’t
you come up and help me to shoot the rabbits?
They are getting beyond the keepers’ control.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Dom and Carew glance at each other.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Can we?’ says Carew. They seem a little
tongue-tied.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘As often as ever you like. Look here, be
up at six to-morrow morning, and we’ll catch
them feeding. And if you will stay and
breakfast with me, it will be a kindness to a
solitary man.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, thank you!’ says Dominick rapturously.
Carew, however, looks a little crestfallen,
whereupon Dom begins to whisper in his ear.
The words ‘every second shot’ reach Mr.
Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If either of you wants a gun, I can find
you one,’ says he carelessly, after which joy
unruffled reigns. ‘I make only one stipulation,’
he adds: ‘that you won’t shoot me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, hang it, we are not such duffers as
that!’ says Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>They all laugh at this, and all, as usual,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>accompany him to the gate to give him a
kind send-off.</p>

<p class='c004'>As he disappears up the road past the
little side-gate of the Cottage, Dom makes
a rush back to the house. ‘I must go and
polish up the old gun,’ says he. Betty
follows him, with Tom and Jacky.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How kind he is!’ says Susan, turning to
Carew. Her tone is warm and grateful.
There is no doubt that Carew’s answer would
have been equally warm, but it never comes.</p>

<p class='c004'>A little sound—the creaking of a rusty
hinge—at this moment attracts his attention,
and Susan’s also. They glance quickly
towards the little green gate of the Cottage.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is slowly opening!</p>

<p class='c004'>And now a face peeps out—very cautiously,
very nervously.</p>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘Dear, if you knew what tears they shed</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Who live apart from home and friend,</div>
      <div class='line'>To pass my house, by pity led,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Your steps would tend.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>It is the face that had peeped out of the
branches of the sycamore-tree a little while
ago. A charming face! The eyes glance
down the little lane, and then, suddenly seeing
Susan, rest with a frightened expression
on her. As this is the first time in all
Susan’s experience that anyone has ever
betrayed the smallest fear of her, she
naturally gives herself up to the contemplation
of her new-born slave. Her eyes and
those of the mysterious stranger meet.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, how pretty!’ thinks Susan to herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>but she says nothing, being lost in wonder
and admiration; and the girl, peeping out
of the doorway, as if disheartened, draws
back again, and will in another minute disappear
altogether, but for Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>He makes a sharp gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Wait!’ cries he, in a low tone, though
hardly conscious that he is speaking at all.
And again the pretty frightened head comes
into sight between the leaves of the luxuriant
ivy that frames the gate.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan!’ says Carew, in a voice of low
and hurried entreaty; and Susan, responding
to it, speeds quickly up the road and
into the little gateway.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, come in—come in!’ breathes the
stranger in a whisper, putting out her hands
and catching Susan’s in a soft grasp. ‘I
have seen you so often; I’—flushing and
smiling timidly—‘have watched you from
the sycamore many a day. And it’s very
lonely here. You will come in for a moment,
won’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan smiles back at her, and passes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>through the small green gate. Ella, pleased
and palpitating, glances back, to see Carew
looking after them like a young culprit at
the door of a forbidden paradise.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Won’t you come too?’ cries she, beneath
her breath, in that soft, curiously frightened
sort of a way that seems to belong to her.
‘Hurry! hurry!’ She looks anxious, and it
is only, indeed, when Carew has come inside
the gate, and she has with her own fingers
fastened and secured it, that the brightness
returns to her face.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s very good of you,’ says she, smiling
rather shyly at Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no!’ cries Susan, with a charming
courtesy that belongs to her; ‘it is very
good of you to let us come and see you.
You know’—softly—‘we had heard—understood—that
you did not wish to be intruded
on. That is’—stammering faintly—‘that
you didn’t wish to see people, and so—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is all quite true,’ says the girl distinctly.
‘I don’t want to see people—not
everyone, you know. But sometimes when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>I hear your voices over there’—pointing
towards the Rectory garden—‘laughing and
talking, I have felt a little lonely.’ She is
looking at Susan, and Susan can see that
her eyes now are a little misty. ‘To-day’—wistfully—‘you
were laughing a great
deal.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes; I wish we hadn’t been,’ says
Susan, who is beginning to feel distinctly
contrite, until she remembers that, after all,
some tears were mingled with her mirth.
‘But now that we have met, you will come
and join us sometimes, won’t you?—and,
indeed, to-day? I wish you had come to-day.
We should all have been glad to see
you—shouldn’t we, Carew?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am sure you know that,’ says Carew
to Ella. A warm colour is dyeing his handsome
young face, and there is the tenderest,
most reverential expression in his voice.
Carew is of that age when ‘the light that
lies in a lady’s eyes’ can mean heaven to
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall never leave this place,’ says Ella
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>quickly. ‘All I want is to stay here, in this
lovely garden, by myself.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yet you said you felt lonely,’ says Susan
anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—I know.’ She looks down, as if
puzzled, uncertain how to go on. ‘Still, I
would rather be lonely than go out into the
world again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor thing!’ thinks Susan. ‘I was right;
no doubt she has just lost everyone that was
dear to her.’ She glances at Ella, as if in
search of crape, but Ella’s navy-blue skirt
and pretty pale-blue linen blouse seem miles
away from woe; and, yes, Betty had seen
that blue bow near her neck.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know this garden so well,’ says Susan,
with a view to changing the sad subject.
‘We used to come here often before you
came. Mr. Wyndham sometimes stayed
here for weeks at a time, but now, of course,
that is all changed. Oh, I see you have
planted out some asters in the round bed.
They will be lovely later on. I suppose’—thoughtfully—‘you
like gardening?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>‘I love it!’ says Ella, with enthusiasm.
‘Only I don’t know anything about it.
Mrs. Denis gives me hints.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I love it, too,’ says Susan, ‘but for all
that’—as if a little ashamed of herself—‘I
like to see people sometimes. I couldn’t
live on gardening alone, and you’ll find you
can’t, either. In fact’—gaily—‘you have
found it out already. That’s why you called
us in. Oh, you’ll have to come over to our
place. Do you like tennis?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have never played it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Golf, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No.’ Her tone is very sad, and Carew
turns sharply upon poor Susan, who had
only meant to do her best.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There are other things in the world
besides golf and tennis,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, of course—of course,’ says Susan
hastily. ‘It is only people who live in the
country who ever really care about things
like that, and no doubt you—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t believe I know anything at all,’
says Ella, very gently.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>‘Well, you know us now, at all events,’
says Carew very happily, with the light and
ready manner that belongs to all large
families. His tone is a little shy, perhaps—the
tone of the boy to the lovely girl, when
first love’s young dream dawns upon him;
but Susan and Ella take the joke very kindly,
and the laughter that follows on it clears
the atmosphere.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are Mr. Wyndham’s tenant, aren’t
you?’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, now’—in a glad and eager voice—‘though
at first I wasn’t.’ She pauses here,
drawing back, as it were. Has she said too
much? Susan, however, has evidently seen
nothing in the small admission.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I like Mr. Wyndham,’ says she. ‘We
all do, indeed. What we are afraid of now
is that, as you have the Cottage, we shan’t
see so much of him. But perhaps’—gaily—‘you
will put him up sometimes, and
then we can renew our acquaintance with
him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Carew turns an awful crimson, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>casts a glance, meant to annihilate, upon the
innocent Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know; I’m not sure,’ says Ella
dejectedly. Evidently she has seen as little
in Susan’s suggestion as Susan herself. ‘He
has only been here once since I came, and
Mrs. Denis seems to think he won’t come
very often. I wish he would come, and I’m
glad you like him, because I like him too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Carew here begins to wonder if he ever
had liked Wyndham, and on the whole
thinks not.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella has taken a step towards Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is your name?’ asks she timidly,
but very sweetly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan Barry.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That sounds like the beginning of the
Catechism,’ says Carew, who is, as we know,
a clergyman’s son, and therefore up to little
points like this.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I knew it,’ says Ella, still very shyly, to
Susan—‘I knew it in a way. Mrs. Denis
told me. But I wanted to be quite sure.
You are Miss Barry?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>‘Oh no; only Susan,’ says the pretty
proprietor of that name. ‘My aunt is Miss
Barry. But I hope you will call me Susan.
It is’—mournfully—‘a dreadfully ugly name,
isn’t it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no; indeed, I like it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you will like mine,’ says Carew,
breaking into the conversation. ‘It is
Carew. Susan and the others call it Crew,
but that’s an abbreviation of me to which
I object. But your name,’ says he. ‘We
should like to know that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Has he thrown a bomb into the assembly?
Something, at all events, has stricken the
stranger dumb. She shrinks backwards,
playing with a branch of the Wigelia rosea
near her, as if to hide her embarrassment.
What is her name? She tells herself that
she does not know, that she disbelieves in
the name forced upon her by those dreadful
people she had lived with after—After
what? Even that is vague to her. Was
it after her mother’s death? Hints and
innuendoes from the Moores had given her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>to believe that Moore, at all events, was not
her real name. But beyond that she knows
nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My name is Ella,’ says she, in a miserable
tone. ‘Call me that if—you will.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Such a pretty name!’ says Susan. ‘Why
did you think we shouldn’t like it? So
much nicer than Susan. Isn’t mine horrid?
But what is your other name?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here they all start. A loud ring at the
big gate over there has taken them from
their own immediate concerns—to another.
Ella turns deadly white, and shows a distinct
desire to get behind Susan. Mrs. Denis is
to be seen in the distance, flying towards the
entrance-gate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Presently it is opened by her, and Wyndham
walks in.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Wyndham pauses in the gateway, and then
comes forward. His astonishment at seeing
the two Barrys here is unbounded, so unbounded,
indeed, that Ella, who has been
the first to see him, and who therefore
naturally has been the first to notice it, is
quite frightened. She goes quickly to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was my fault. I asked them to come
in. Do you mind?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I mind? I quite understood that it was
you who would mind,’ says he. There is
no time for any more. Susan has come
forward.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>‘How d’ye do, Mr. Wyndham?’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham gives her his hand mechanically,
murmuring the usual meaningless,
but courteous, words of greeting that are
expected of one, no matter what worries
lie on the heart, troubling and mystifying it.
And Wyndham, in spite of his reputation of
being one of the smartest barristers in Dublin,
has, to tell the truth, been considerably
mystified of late.</p>

<p class='c004'>The day after he left Ella, he had gone to
that part of Dublin described by her as the
place where the man Moore lived. A squalid
place, though still with an air of broken
respectability about it, and with quite an extraordinary
number of ill-dressed urchins
playing about the hall doorsteps. They
were of that class, that though their garments
were almost in rags they had still
shoes and stockings, of sorts, on their feet,
and an attempt at a frayed collar round their
necks. It gave Wyndham a sense of disgust
to think that the girl who was now living in
his dainty cottage had once lived in such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>atmosphere as this; and when he had gone
down the hideous road twenty yards or so,
the certainty that had begun at the first
yard—that she could never have lived there—had
deepened. But this idea gave him
little comfort. If she had ever lived here, it
was only, to say the least of it, deplorable.
If she had not lived here, she had lied to him,
and was an impostor. And if the latter
supposition was true, he had rented his
cottage to an impostor, and a clever one, too.
She had taken him in, beyond all doubt.
And he was looked upon as rather a bright
and shining light amongst his <i><span lang="fr">confrères</span></i> at the
Bar and at the University Club, and in the
various other resorts for rising young men in
Dublin.</p>

<p class='c004'>When he knocked at the door of the house
mentioned by her, he told himself that of
course he had come on a fool’s errand; yet,
when the woman who answered the door—a
highly respectable person, and frightfully
dirty, in a respectable way—told him ‘that
no Moores lived here,’ he felt as though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>someone had struck him. He must have
looked extremely taken back, because the
respectably-dirty lady roused herself sufficiently
from the dignity that seemed to cling
to her as closely as her grime, and condescended
to say she had only been there a
short time, ‘an’ p’raps Mrs. Morgan, nex’
door, could give him the information he was
lookin’ for.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham had taken the hint—he scarcely
knew why—and had gone ‘nex’ door,’ to
receive, as he honestly believed, the same
answer. But no! Mrs. Morgan, in a tight-fitting
gown, draggled at the tail, and with
her sparse front locks in curl-papers (she said
‘curling-tongs an’ methylated spirit played
the very juice wid your hair’), gave him a
very handsome amount of news about the
missing Moore.</p>

<p class='c004'>She was a very genial person, in spite of
the curl-papers—or perhaps because of them—and
she invited Wyndham into her ‘best
front’ in the most cordial way—even though
she knew he was not going to take it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Yes; of course she had known Mr. Moore.
He used to live next door, but some months
ago his wife died, and he had seemed a little
unsettled like since.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There was a girl?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes—Ella Moore.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Their daughter?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Law, no, sir! Her niece, poor Mrs. Moore
would call her at times, but I don’t think she
was even that. I don’t know the truth of it
rightly; but that girl was “quite the lady,”
sir, round here. An’ she found some people
who took her up an’ had her as governess for
their children—big people out in some o’ the
squares. Mrs. Moore had her with her when
she took the house nex’ door. Ella was a
little creature then, an’ used to be cryin’
always for someone—her mother, I used to
say. But Mrs. Moore was very dark, entirely,
an’ never let out. Is it about Ella you’re
comin’, sir? I’d be glad to hear good of her.
But I suppose you know she fled out of
Moore’s house one night, an’ was never seen
again? Some said as how Moore wanted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>murder her, or did murder her; but he
wasn’t a man for that, I say. Any way, up
he sticks, and disappears after a bit. The
police looked into it for a while, but nothin’
came of it. They do say’—mysteriously—‘that
Moore wanted to marry her, and that
she’d have nothin’ to do with him. But, law,
some people would say anythin’! An’, of
course, he was old enough to be her father.
You wouldn’t be likely to know anythin’ of
her, sir?’—in the wheedling tone of the confirmed
gossip.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Wyndham calmly. ‘What I
want is the man Moore. You can tell me
nothing, then?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, sir.... Get out!’—to two or three
little children who have appeared on the
threshold, anxious, no doubt, for their dinner,
and wondering what is keeping their mammy.
‘But if you did hear of Miss Ella—we all
used to call her “Miss Ella,” though she was,
as it might be, one of ourselves—I’d be glad
to get a word from you. She was very good
to my little Katie, an’ she would come in of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>an evenin’ an’ give her a lesson, just as if
I could pay for it. There was very few like
her, sir, an’ that I tell you,’ says Mrs. Morgan,
whose eyes, in spite of her wonderful dirtiness,
are handsome now because of the honest,
kindly tears that shine in them. ‘An’ it’s
me own opinion,’ goes on the grimy woman,
‘that she never belonged to them Moores at
all—that she was stolen like by Mr. Moore.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Or by his wife?’ suggests Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no, poor soul!’ says Mrs. Morgan.
‘She’—with delicate phraseology—‘hadn’t a
kick in her. But we often said—my husband
and I—that perhaps Mrs. Moore had been a
servant in some great family, an’ had taken a—a
child, that—beggin’ yer pardon, sir—mightn’t
be altogether wanted.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This view of Mrs. Morgan’s takes root in
Wyndham’s mind. An illegitimate child!
An unacknowledged scion of some good
family! Poor, poor child! poor Ella!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You may be right,’ he said. The interview
was at an end. Seeing two of Mrs.
Morgan’s children peeping in again, hungry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>and disconsolate, he beckons them to him,
and after awhile they slowly, and with open
distrust, creep towards him. Was that the
Katie—that little dark-eyed, handsome child—that
she used to teach? Wyndham caught
her and drew her towards him, and pressed
half-a-sovereign into her hand, and then
caught the little boy hanging on her scanty
skirts, and pressed another little yellow piece
into his soft but unwashed palm, after which
he bid the grateful Mrs. Morgan adieu, and
walked out of their lives for ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>But what she had told him went with him.
Who is this girl Ella Moore—this girl who
is now his tenant? He had insisted on her
being his tenant, on her paying him rent.
That was as much to satisfy her as to satisfy
some scruples of his own. She was really, of
course, no more to him than any other tenant
might be—and yet—</p>

<p class='c004'>For one thing, who is she? One does not,
as a rule, rent one’s houses to people, not only
unknown and without a reference, but actually
without a name.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>‘I quite understood it was you who would
mind.’ There was rancour in the voice that
had spoken those few words, and the rancour
had gone to Ella’s heart. Was he angry
with her?—displeased? Should she not
have asked the Barrys to come in? She
loses her colour and shrinks back a little, and
Carew, glancing from her to Wyndham,
whilst the latter is murmuring his greetings
to Susan, tells himself that Wyndham is
a brute, with a big, big B, and that in some
way this mysterious girl—this lovely girl—has
her life made miserable by him. This
is, as we know, manifestly unfair, as it is
really Wyndham whose life is being made
distinctly uncomfortable by this ‘lovely,
mysterious girl.’ But Carew is too young to
see a second side to any question that has his
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think we must go now,’ says Susan,
holding out her hand to her new acquaintance.
‘It is very late—too late’—smiling—‘for
a formal visit.’ Wyndham winces. Is
his informal? ‘But we shall pay that soon,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>now that we know we may come. And, of
course, you and your—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She pauses, the thought coming to her that
she really does not know if Mr. Wyndham is
actually this pretty girl’s landlord. And,
besides, ‘your landlord’—how badly it
sounds! ‘You and your landlord!’ Oh,
impossible! She had been very near making
a great mistake.</p>

<p class='c004'>So she hesitates, and Wyndham misinterprets
her pause. He feels furious. What
was the word she was going to use? ‘Lover,’
no doubt, in the innocence of her young and
abominably stupid heart. He feels brutal
even towards the unconscious Susan just
now. Yes, that is what all the small world
round here will think. His colour rises, and
he feels all at once guilty, as though the very
worst facts could be laid to his charge, whilst
all the time he is innocent. Innocent! Oh,
confound it! the situation is absolutely
maddening&#160;... and if it comes to the old
man’s ears! Lord Shangarry is not one to
be easily entreated, or to be convinced,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>either.... An obstinate old man, who, if
he once caught an idea into his old brain,
would find it very hard to let it go again.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And, of course, you and Mr. Wyndham,’
says Susan now, hastily, not understanding
Wyndham’s frown, ‘have many matters to
discuss.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The speech is wound up very satisfactorily,
after all.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly not. I beg you won’t go on
my account,’ says Wyndham stiffly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not for that,’ says Susan gaily, ‘but
because father will be wondering where we
are.’ Wyndham, who has already heard a
little of the gossip that is beginning to
circulate around the Cottage, almost groans
aloud here. Father would be wondering
indeed if he only knew. ‘By-the-by, Mr.
Wyndham, now that’—she looks at Ella
and holds out her hand to her—‘she tells us
she would like to see us here sometimes, we
can come, can’t we?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She smiles delightfully at Wyndham, and
the wretched man smiles back at her in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>way that should have moved her to tears had
she seen him, but, providentially, after a
mere passing glance at him, she has given her
attention to Ella, who pleases her imagination
immensely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly, if Miss Moore wishes it,’ says
he. ‘You know this place is no longer mine.
Miss Moore is my tenant now. She is, therefore,
at liberty to do what she likes with it.
You must not ask me what she can or cannot
do. I am that most disagreeable of all things,
a landlord—nothing more.’</p>

<p class='c004'>His tone is even colder than he means it to
be. The Rector—what will he say when he
hears of this visit of Susan’s? The Rector,
who is so ultra-particular, and this girl without
a name—so almost certainly illegitimate!
Fancy the Rector’s face when he hears of
this thoughtless visit of Susan’s! Mr. Barry
is a good man, and charitable in his own line,
but to give his countenance to a friendship
between his daughter and a girl nameless—unknown!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We are telling her,’ goes on Susan sweetly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>‘that she must come and see us sometimes,
too—just across the road, you know. But
she says she will not. Can’t you persuade
her, Mr. Wyndham, though you are only her
landlord, as you say?’ Is there meaning in
her tone? Does she think? Wyndham
glances at her suspiciously, and then knows
he ought to be ashamed of himself. ‘Still,
landlords have weight, and you know father
would be so pleased if she would come to us
sometimes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I dare say,’ says Wyndham, who can
almost see Mr. Barry’s face when the idea
is suggested to him. The Rector, with his
aristocratic tendencies, that the very depths
of poverty have not been able to subdue,
would think it monstrous, Susan’s being here
at all with a girl so wrapped in mystery—a
girl so enveloped in the base gossip that
already is arising about her in the neighbourhood,
because of her strange tenancy of
the Cottage—a gossip that must inevitably
include him, Wyndham, too. How is her
coming here to be accounted for? Who will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>hold him guiltless of the knowledge of her
coming?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you are going,’ says he, turning
suddenly to Susan, ‘I shall go with you; I
wish to speak to your father.’ He has made
up his mind on the moment to lay the whole
affair open to the Rector. It seems the only
thing to be done, if his tenant has decided
on knowing the Barrys. ‘You tell me Miss
Moore is anxious—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your name is Moore, then?’ says Susan
gently, going a step towards her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not!’ says the girl almost passionately.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a silence; Wyndham, feeling the
water closing over him more and more still,
with the girl’s troubled eyes upon him, comes
to the rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is, at all events, the only name by
which she is known at present,’ says he to
Susan. ‘I am looking into her affairs, and
hope in time to be able to unravel them.
That is the good of being a barrister, you
see. And now—if you are ready?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Susan bids good-bye again to Ella, who is
looking a little subdued and uncertain now;
Carew does the same, holding her hand
lingeringly, as if wishing to say something
sympathetic to her, but finding words fail
him. Wyndham, following him and Susan,
would have passed through the gate into the
road outside, but that Ella, with a quick,
softly-spoken word, full of emotion, stops him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have done something wrong,’ says she,
in a breathless whisper. ‘Wait—do wait—one
moment, and tell me, tell me—’ Tears
are standing thick within her eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is much to tell you,’ says he impatiently.
‘But no time in which to tell it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘About—’ Her face pales, and she
looks eagerly at him, laying even a restraining
hand upon his arm in her growing
fear.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—about that fellow.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Moore?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you will stay—you will tell me!’
cries she, in low but panting tones. ‘Oh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>don’t leave me in suspense. Even if you
can’t stay now, you can come back again, if
only for five minutes! Oh, do! You will?
He—’ She looks as if she were going to
faint.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is no need for fear of that sort,’
says he quickly. ‘He knows nothing of
you, or where you are. Yes, if I can’—reluctantly—‘I
will come back.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He follows the others now, and as he
reaches Susan and Carew, they all three
distinctly hear the click of the lock of the
garden-gate behind them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan looks at Wyndham in a startled
way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—I think someone must have been very
unkind to her,’ says she; ‘don’t you? To
lock herself up like that, and never to want
to see anybody. Mr. Wyndham, why don’t
you try to find out her enemies?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am trying,’ says Wyndham, looking
into the calm, earnest, intelligent eyes raised
to his.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Father would help you,’ says Susan.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>‘Was it because of that you wanted to see
him to-day?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is no time for more.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Barry is coming up the road. He
had evidently seen them all come out of
the green gate of the Cottage. His face is
grave and stern.</p>

      <div class='line'>‘Mystery magnifies danger, as a fog the sun.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>His greeting to Wyndham is of the coldest.
He does not speak to him, but turns at once
to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your aunt wants you,’ says he severely.
And the girl, a little chilled, a little apprehensive,
disappears within the Rectory gate,
carrying Carew, a most unwilling captive,
with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>When she is gone, the Rector faces
Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How is this, Wyndham?’ asks he quietly,
yet with unmistakable indignation.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How is what?’ asks the young man a
little haughtily.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>‘Was it you who took Susan into that
cottage?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; but even if it had been, I see no
cause for the tone you have assumed towards
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is what I suppose you call “carrying
it off,”’ says the Rector, his pale face betraying
a fine disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Barry!’ says Wyndham, as if the
other had struck him.</p>

<p class='c004'>He has flushed a dark red, and now turns
as if to walk straight away up the road and
out of the Rector’s ken for ever. But suddenly
he halts and looks back, and Mr. Barry,
who has seen many phases of life and is quick
to discern the truth, however deep in the
well it lies, beckons to him to return. If this
young man cannot clear himself, he may still
plead circumstances.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you could explain, Wyndham.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s what offends me,’ says Wyndham,
with some passion. He has refused to return
an inch, so the Rector has had to go to him.
It wouldn’t do to shout his conversation, considering
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>all the young people who live on one
side of the road behind the right-hand wall,
and the one ‘young person’ (the Rector has
the gravest suspicions) who lives on the
other side of it. What if they should all
chance to hear?</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham is still talking.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why should I have to explain? You
have known me many years, Mr. Barry. Of
what’—looking him fair in the face—‘do you
accuse me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That hardly requires an answer,’ says Mr.
Barry calmly. And all at once Wyndham
knows that the trouble he had dreamed of is
already on him. There is gossip rife in the
neighbourhood about him and this mysterious
tenant of his cottage. People are talking—soon
it will come to the old man’s ears, and
to his aunt’s, and to Josephine’s. The last
idea is the least troublesome. ‘You must
surely have heard some rumours yourself. I
am willing, I am most anxious,’ says the
Rector, with growing earnestness, ‘to hear
the truth of a story that seems, as it now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>stands, to be disastrous to two people. You,
Wyndham, are one of them. No, not a
word. Hear me first. I want to say just
this: that if I was a little harsh to you a
moment ago, it was because of Susan. One’s
daughter has the first claim. And she—that
child—to be—You tell me you did not
take her to see—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I told you that,’ says Wyndham, ‘and I
told you, too’—very straightly—‘that if I
had done so I should see no reason why I
should be ashamed of it. However, I had
nothing to do with your daughter’s visit to
Miss Moore. It appears Miss Moore asked
her to come into my—her—’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rector stops him with an impatient
gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Whose is it, yours or hers?’ asks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mine, yet hers in a sense, too,’ begins and
ends the fluent lawyer, whose fluency has
now, at his need, deserted him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do not understand your evasions.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you will let me—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I want no explanations,’ says the Rector
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>coldly. ‘I want only one answer to one
plain question: Who is this Miss Moore?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He looks straight at Wyndham. The
extenuating circumstances he had believed
in grow smaller and smaller.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham hesitates. Who is she, indeed?
Who is this tenant of his?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You hesitate, I see,’ says Mr. Barry.
‘You have the grace to do even so much.
But at all events you cannot deny that you
permitted the presence of my young daughter
in that place beyond.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A truce to subterfuges, sir!’ cries the
Rector. ‘A plain answer I will and must
get. Who is this girl who lives in your
house and refuses to see or know anyone in
her neighbourhood?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know,’ says Wyndham sullenly,
angered beyond control.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do,’ says the Rector, ‘and may God
forgive you for your sin! She is—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Be silent!’ cries Wyndham, interrupting
him so imperiously that the older man stops
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>short. ‘She is my tenant—my tenant, I
repeat, and’—haughtily—‘no more.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Silence follows upon this. The Rector,
lost in thought, stands with clasped hands
behind his back and his eyes upon the
ground. His silence incenses Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can believe me or not, as you like,’
says he, turning on his heel.</p>

<p class='c004'>He moves away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Stay, stay,’ cries Mr. Barry suddenly.
‘We must get to the end of this. If I have
wronged you, Wyndham, I regret it with all
my heart; but there has been some talk
here, and Susan—she is very young, a mere
child. I could not stand that. You tell me
there is nothing to be condemned in all this
business—that she, this girl in there, is only
your tenant. But landlords do not visit
their tenants except on compulsion, so far as
I know; and you—what has brought you
here to-day?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just that,’ says Wyndham, who is still at
white heat—‘compulsion. If you would
condescend’—angrily—‘to listen to my explanation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>I might, perhaps, make you understand.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall be only too glad to listen,’ says
Mr. Barry, with dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But here—how can I explain here?’ says
Wyndham, glancing round at the open road
and the walls. ‘Walls have ears.’</p>

<p class='c004'>But Mr. Barry does not budge, and Wyndham
gives way to rather sardonic laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose,’ says he, ‘you would not let
me under your roof until this is perfectly
clear?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rector still remains immovable.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The roof of heaven is above us always,’
returns he. Whereupon Wyndham, who has
sympathy with determination, laughs again,
but more naturally this time, and forthwith
tells him the whole story of his acquaintance
with Ella from that first strange night until
to-day.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Bless me!’ says the Rector, when the
recital is at an end. He strokes his clean-shaven
chin thoughtfully. ‘What an extraordinary
tale!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>‘Not too extraordinary to be believed, I
hope?’—stiffly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no. I believe you, Wyndham—I
believe you thoroughly,’ says the Rector
gently. ‘I am indeed sorry for my late
distrust of you; but you will admit that
there was cause. That poor girl! You have
utterly failed, then, to discover those people
with whom she had been living before that—that
dreadful night?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So far, yes. But the fact that they once
did live there goes far to establish the truth
of her—’ He stammers a little, but Mr.
Barry takes him up:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Her story? It entirely, in my opinion,
establishes the truth of her story.’ Wyndham’s
stammer has added to the truth of his
declaration so far as the Rector is concerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have a more liberal mind than mine,’
says Wyndham. ‘I have told you so much
that I may as well make you my father
confessor <i><span lang="it">in toto</span></i>.’ The smile that accompanies
this is rather strained. ‘As a fact,
there was a time when I did not believe in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>her story myself; and now, when I have to—well,
it makes me feel rather poor, you
know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have no occasion to feel anything,’
says the Rector, ‘except that you have been
a kind friend to her. Do you think you will
be able to trace that fellow Moore?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope so. I have engaged a detective—one
of the smartest fellows in Dublin—and I
depend upon him to run down that scoundrel
in a month or so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In the meantime I shall make it my business
to explain to everybody how matters
really are,’ says the Rector. ‘To tell the
people we know round here that—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I beg you won’t,’ says Wyndham hurriedly.
‘Have I not told you how she desires privacy
above all things, how she dreads her discovery
by that man? I know it all sounds
mysterious, Mr. Barry—that it is asking a
great deal of your credulity to expect you to
believe it all—but I still hope you will believe
me, and at all events I know her secret is
safe in your hands. I myself have thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>of suggesting to her to face matters bravely,
and if Moore should prove troublesome, why,
to fight it out with him. I cannot believe he
has any actual claim on her; but she has
such an almost obstinate determination not
to risk the chance of meeting him that I fear
she will not be moved by what I say. This
shutting of herself up in that cottage seems
a mania with her—such a mania that I
cannot but think her story true, and that she
suffered considerably at that fellow’s hands.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It looks like it,’ says the Rector.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Perhaps you will be able to combat her
fears,’ says Wyndham rather awkwardly.
‘I should be very glad if you could, as this
mystery surrounding her is—er—decidedly
uncomfortable for me. You have seen that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wonder you ever consented to the
arrangement.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I never meant to, but she seemed so
utterly friendless, and she seemed to cling
so to this place (a harbour of refuge it was to
her, evidently), that I found it would be
almost brutal to refuse.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>‘It was a charitable deed,’ says the
Rector.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not done in a spirit of charity, however.
I assure you I regret it more and more every
day of my life,’ says Wyndham, with a short
laugh. ‘However, in for a penny, in for a
pound, you know, and I had promised the
Professor to look after her. I have now
engaged a companion for her. I think you
may remember Miss Manning. She was a
governess of the Blakes’ some years ago.
You used to know them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Manning? Oh, of course, of course,’ says
the Rector—‘a most worthy creature. I
never knew what became of her after Mary
Blake went to India.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Got another situation, and a most
miserable one. Left it, and was found in
direst poverty by the person I got to hunt
her up. Her delight at my proposal to her
to live with Miss Moore was unbounded. It
will, at all events, be a blessing to get her
out of that stuffy room I found her in. She
looked so out of place in it. You know what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>a nice-looking woman she was, and so well
got up always. But yesterday&#160;... I
advanced her a little of her salary at once—to—to
get anything she might want, you
know; and I expect that next week she will
come to the Cottage.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rector has heard this rather halting
recital straight through without comment.
Now he lifts his eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are a good fellow, Wyndham,’ says
he slowly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For heaven’s sake, Mr. Barry, not that,’
says Wyndham impatiently. ‘I expect I’m
about the most grudging devil on earth.
And if you think I enjoy helping this girl,
or Miss Manning, or anyone else, you make
a mistake. What I really want is to be left
alone, to run my life on my own rails without
the worry of being crossed or stopped by
passengers, or goods, or extras.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, we can none of us hope for that,’
says the Rector. ‘The most selfish of us
have to live, not only for ourselves, but for
others. You spoke of having seen Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Manning yesterday. Have you—told the
young lady in there of her coming?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not yet. I had no time, indeed. When
I found your daughter there, I felt I ought
to take her away as soon as possible, simply
because you did not know how matters were,
and I had a hint—as to gossip. I must go
back now, however, and tell her before my
train leaves.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have little time,’ says the Rector,
glancing at his watch. ‘Go. Make haste.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There is one thing more,’ says Wyndham
quickly, ‘and I think you should hear it.
She—I don’t know anything for certain—but
I feel almost sure that the poor girl is
illegitimate. And, of course, you—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You would not like an acquaintance
between her and your daughters?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You mistake me there,’ says the Rector;
‘a misfortune is not a fault. And the fact
that this poor girl has been the victim of
others’ vices should not be allowed to militate
against her.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>‘Hardly a fact,’ says Wyndham quickly.
‘I speak only from very uncertain data, and
yet—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know. It seems, unhappily, only too
likely, however. There, go; you have little
time.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>‘It is very stupid of me, I know,’ says she,
reddening at his glance of surprise. ‘But
the other day I thought’—paling—‘that I
saw him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Moore?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where could you see him, as you never
leave this?’ He is still feeling a little sore
about her determination to hold herself aloof
from everyone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’—reddening—‘was up in that tree over
there’—pointing to the sycamore.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Up there! What on earth for?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wanted’—here poor Ella hangs her
head—‘to see into the Rectory garden.
They—they were all laughing there, and I
could hear them, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She stops short in her somewhat dismal
confession.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see,’ says Wyndham quickly, all his
coldness suddenly dying away. Poor child!
this little picture of her climbing with difficulty
into that great tree to catch even a
glimpse of the gaiety of others goes to his
heart. ‘Was it there that—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>‘Yes; it was there I thought I saw him.
I may—I must’—anxiously—‘have been
mistaken—don’t you think I must have been
mistaken?—but I did see a man just like
him turning up the corner of the road that
leads to the village street.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am sure you were mistaken,’ says
Wyndham. ‘As a fact, I know he has
disappeared altogether. If he wanted to
spy upon you here, if he thought you were
in the country anywhere, what would be
more likely than that he should live in his
old house, and make expeditions round about
Dublin with a view to coming upon you
sooner or later? But I have heard from
the woman who lived next door to him
that—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Morgan?’ says Ella eagerly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; Mrs. Morgan.’ He pauses, and is
quite conscious of a glow of satisfaction at
her words. They are, indeed, ‘confirmation
strong’ of the truth of her story all through.
She had known this Mrs. Morgan and been
known by her. ‘And,’ cries Ella eagerly,
‘she said—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>‘That he had left his house immediately
after your disappearance. That looks as if
your going had frightened him, as if he
thought he might be made answerable to
the law for your safety, as if he feared you
had—that is—’ He stammers here a
little.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know,’ says the girl, interrupting him
gently. ‘As if he feared—I had put an end
to my life. And’—painfully—‘as you know—I
was willing to risk the chance of losing
it, at all events.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, there was no risk,’ says Wyndham
hastily. ‘But what I want to say is that
I believe Moore fancied himself liable to
prosecution if he could not say what had
become of you. He had treated you
abominably, and no doubt the neighbours
were talking, and—’ He himself is talking
quite at random now. He has not yet
got over his late ‘slip.’ ‘Any way, his not
being seen since points to the fact that he
has gone abroad.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no,’ says the girl, shaking her head
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>with conviction. She is very pale now.
‘To me it seems that he has left home to
look for me. I know—I know’—affrightedly—‘that
he is looking for me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just because you saw a fancied resemblance
to him in a man going down the
road?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not that altogether, though that did
give me a shock, and I still fancy—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Come, that is being absolutely morbid,’
says Wyndham, with a touch of impatience.
‘The man is gone, believe me. And even if
not, what claim has he on you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That I don’t know, but he said he had
a “hold on me” until I was twenty-one, and
I am only eighteen’—with a sigh that is
evidently full of a desire to wish away three
good years of her young life.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t believe a word of it,’ says Wyndham
promptly. ‘And in the meantime, now
that in my opinion he is well out of the way,
why don’t you try to enjoy your life—to see
people, to—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am enjoying life. Oh’—with a sudden,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>quick, happy smile—‘if you only knew how
much!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yet you confess to loneliness—to a desire
to see those around you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ She colours and taps her foot on
the ground, then laughs. ‘And now I have
seen them,’ says she, with a swift upward
glance at him that lasts only for a moment.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The Barrys, yes; but there are others,
and now you know the Barrys you can easily
know everyone else down here; you can
make friends for yourself, and go out, and
pay visits, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no!’ cries she quickly, with a sudden
terror, indeed; ‘no, no’—putting up her
hands—‘I can’t—I won’t—I’ll never go out.
Mr. Wyndham, don’t—don’t ask me to do
that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is in Wyndham’s mind to say to her
that it would be of considerable benefit to
his social look-out if she would only consent
to know people, and make herself known,
and break through this deplorable attitude
of secrecy that she has taken up; but a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>glance at her young frightened face deters
him. He shrugs his shoulders over his own
ill-luck, and bears it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I—you are angry with me again,’ says
Ella nervously; ‘but I can’t go out of this
place. I can’t, indeed, unless you could
send me somewhere across the sea where
he could never find me. But to leave this!’
Her lips quiver, and she turns aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense! Who wants you to leave
this?’ says Wyndham roughly. ‘But I
think you ought to have some common-sense
about you. You have no one to give you
advice of any sort, and you are about the
most headstrong girl I ever met.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have taken your advice,’ says she,
‘always—always.’ Her face is still turned
away, and her voice sounds stifled.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Always when it suited you; but not
now, when it might be of some use. Of
course, I can see quite plainly that that old
idiot Mrs. Moriarty is backing you up in all
your nonsensical fears, but there will soon
be an end to that. I have engaged a lady
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>to come and live with you, and give you
lessons, and knock some sense into your
head, I hope.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A lady to live with me? You have
found her, then? You meant it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Naturally I meant it, and I only hope
she will be able to show you the folly of
your ways—a matter in which I have most
signally failed.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham has worked himself into quite
a righteous fever of wrath against her.
Good heavens! what a row there is bound
to be shortly with his aunt about this
obstinate recluse! He has gone a little too
far. The girl turns upon him, gently indeed,
but with a certain dignity in her air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘As I have told you, I can always leave
this,’ says she; ‘but it will be for a place
where I can live alone, and where I shall
never have to leave my home, even though
it be a garret. I—I have thought of a
convent’—her voice faltering—‘but I am a
Protestant, and—’ She sighs heavily.
‘Mr. Wyndham,’ cries she suddenly, ‘why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>do you want me to go out—to know people?
Why?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, who could have given one very
excellent reason for his wish, remains determinedly
silent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You see,’ cries she triumphantly, ‘you
have no reason at all, and I am ever so much
happier by myself! I don’t say but that, if
I were somebody else, I should not like to go
into that garden there’—pointing towards
the Rectory—‘but as it is, it would frighten
me to step outside the gate.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And how long is this state of things to go
on?’ asks Wyndham—‘until you are ninety?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, he can’t live till then,’ says she;
‘and, besides, long before that I shall be old
and ugly, and he won’t care. You know’—growing
crimson—‘what I told you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes.’ Wyndham frowns. ‘You told me
enough to know he was a most infernal
scoundrel.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose he is that,’ says she thoughtfully.
‘Though I don’t think really he would
ever murder anybody. You see, he didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>even murder me. He only wanted to marry
me! That was what made me so angry. If
he had made me marry him’—turning to
Wyndham with a quick, sharp movement—‘you
think that would mean that I should
have to live with him always?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She pauses as if eager for an answer, and
when he does not speak, she says imperatively:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham nods his head.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It wouldn’t, however,’ says she with
angry emphasis. ‘I’d have run away after
I was married, just the same. Only I
thought it better to do it before.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is so much force, so much girlish
venom, in her tone, that Wyndham feels
inclined to laugh; but the little air mutin
she has taken sits so curiously, and with
such an unexpected charm, upon her, that
somehow his laughter dies within him.
Something about her now, too, as she stands
there flushed and defiant, strikes him as
familiar. Who is she like?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>‘For a young lady so very valiant, I
wonder you are so afraid to face the world,’
says he gravely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, I am not afraid of the world, but of
him!’ says she. ‘And’—she draws closer
to him, and now all her bravery has died
away from her, and she looks as greatly in
want of courage as a mouse—‘I’m afraid
of this new lady, too! Is she—kind—nice?
will she—be angry with me sometimes?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very likely,’ says Wyndham. He softens
this disagreeable answer, however, by a smile.
‘No—you must not be afraid of her. She is
an old friend of mine, and very charming.
And she is quite prepared to love you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah! Then you have said—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The very prettiest things of you, of
course’—sardonically—‘so keep up your
courage.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She will come?’—nervously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On Thursday.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘When you and she have reached the point
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>of open war, I dare say she will drop me a
line, to come to her rescue.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It will be to mine,’ says she, smiling, but
very faintly. Tears are in her eyes. ‘You—you
will come with her, won’t you? Don’t
let me have to see her alone at first. You
know her, and I don’t. And you—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very well, I’ll bring her,’ says Wyndham,
with an inward groan. What the deuce is
going to be the end of it all?</p>

<p class='c004'>He does not leave by the little green gate
this time, but going down at a swinging pace
(that has a good deal of temper in it) to the
principal entrance, meets there with Mrs.
Moriarty, who has been on the look-out for
him for the past half-hour.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ did ye hear what happened to Denis,
yer honour?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To Denis?’—abstractedly. Then, recovering
himself, and with a good deal of his late
temper still upon him: ‘Of course I’ve been
wondering all day where he was. Not a soul
to attend to me. He was drunk, as usual, I
suppose.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>‘Fegs, you’ve guessed it,’ says Mrs. Moriarty,
clapping her hands with unbounded
admiration. ‘Dhrunk he was—the ould
reprobate!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I hope he’ll turn up this evening,
at all events,’ says Wyndham. ‘It is extremely
uncomfortable, going on like this.
If he can’t attend to me, I’ll have to get
another man. I have borne a good deal
already, and I hope you will let him fully
understand that if he isn’t at my rooms at
seven I shall dismiss him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An’ who’d blame ye?’ says Mrs. Moriarty.
‘Faith, I’ve often thought of dismissing him
meself. But’—slowly—‘he can’t be at yer
rooms at seven, yer honour.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And why not?’—angrily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s bruk his arm, sir.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Broke his arm?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Just that, sir, bad scran to him! An’
the docther says he never saw a worse compound
fraction in his life. ’Twas all through
Timsey Mooney. Timsey and him’s at war
for a long time, an’ yestherday Timsey said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>he’d break his head, an’ with that Denis said
he’d have the life ov him; and ’twas the
divil’s own row they had afther that, only’—with
a regretful air—‘it was Denis’s arm
that got bruk, an’ not Timsey’s head.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So Denis got his arm broken?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, sir. An’ that Timsey Mooney as
sound as iver! Not a scratch on him. I’ve
alwas tould ye that there’s nayther luck nor
grace wid Denis. But what am I wastin’
words on him at all for? ’Tis about the
young lady I’m curious. She’s to stay,
sir?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—yes. I told you that before. And
I have arranged with a friend of mine, a
very accomplished lady, to come down here
and live with her as a companion.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A companion is it?’ Mrs. Moriarty
strokes her beard. ‘She’s been very continted
wid me,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I dare say. But this lady, Miss Manning,
is to be a governess to her, to teach her—to
see to her manners, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To tache her her manners is it? She’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>got the purtiest manners I ever yet see,’
says Mrs. Moriarty, with a smothered indignation.
‘Tache her, indeed!’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is plain that Mrs. Moriarty is already
consumed with the pangs of jealousy.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is coming, at all events,’ says Wyndham
shortly. ‘And I request you will treat
her with every respect, as one of my oldest
friends.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She’s ould, thin?’—anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is not young.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Mrs. Moriarty shakes her head with the
air of one who would say: ‘We all know
what that means.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is she kind-hearted, sir? Miss Ella is
terrible timid-like.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly she is kind. But, of course,
she will expect “Miss Ella,” as you call her,
to follow her lead in most ways. I’—with
meaning—‘shall take care she is not interfered
with in any way. I hope you quite
understand all this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I understhand, yer honour. She’s ould
an’ cross, an’ Miss Ella is to follow her about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>everywhere. But’—with a last lingering
remnant of hope—‘she won’t be comin’ for
a while, sir, will she?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She is coming on Thursday.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, murther!’ says Mrs. Moriarty <i><span lang="it">sotto
voce</span></i>, as he shuts the gate behind him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>
  <h2 class='c008'>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>
</div>
<p class='c009'>‘Ther is ful many a man that crieth, “Werre,
werre,” that wat ful litel what werre amounteth.
Werre at his begynnyng hath so greet an entre and
so large, that everywight may entre when him liketh
and lightly find werre; but certes what ende schal
falle thereof, it is not lightly to knowe!’</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Nothing will do for these beastly hens, it
seems, but the garden,’ says Betty indignantly.
‘Susan, stand there, you—no,
there!’—gasping.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, they’ve scratched up all the mignonette,’
cries Susan, rushing to the point
indicated—an escallonia bush in which three
culprit hens are lurking. ‘Were there ever
such wretches? And plenty of food in the
yard, too! It isn’t as if they were
starved. Cush! cush! Bother them! They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>won’t come out. Have you got a stick,
Betty?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Here’s one. I declare I’m out of breath
from hunting them. And the cock is the
worst of all. I hope I’ll live to see the broth
he is made into; not that I’d touch it—it
would be too full of all malice and bitterness.
Hi! hi!’ with a frantic dab at the hens with
her stick beneath the too friendly escallonia—‘there
is one of them, Susan; run—run to
the gate! She’s going that way. Ah! you’ve
got that, any way.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That,’ I regret to say, is a stone directed
with unerring aim by Betty, and received by
the hen on her shoulder with a shock that
makes her bound, not only into the air, but
‘over the garden wall’ and into the yard
beyond, with a haste that perhaps she calls
undue. And now Susan has routed out the
other two, and, with a cackling that would
rouse the dead, they rush after their companion
towards that spot in the wall that is
easiest for the purposes of ingress and egress
from the yard to the garden. Susan races
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>after them, ‘shoo-ing’ with all her might,
generously supported by Betty and her
shower of small stones. So ardent, so bloodthirsty,
is the chase, it is matter for wonder
that the hens, having once gone through
such an encounter, could ever brave it again.
But hens are amongst the bravest things
living—Amazons in their own line. It is
indeed popularly supposed in our neighbourhood
that the souls of those defunct termagants
have entered into them, and, at all
events, there does not rest a doubt now in
the minds of Susan and Betty that in half an
hour’s time those hens will have returned to
the charge, as fresh as ever.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We must get a wire netting put up along
there,’ says Betty angrily. ‘What’s the
good of our planting seeds and roots and
things for the amusement of those abominable
hens? And why should they think there
are more grubs under a picotee than under a
common daisy?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish there was a netting put up,’ says
Susan, who is distinctly flushed. ‘But who’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>going to do it? Father won’t. Wiring costs
something, and there would be a good bit of
it to be put up there’—pointing to the long
wall.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Maybe Dom would, when he gets his next
half-year’s allowance.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think you ought to ask him,’ says
Susan. ‘He is not our brother, you know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He’s nearly as good,’ says Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, he isn’t, and I, for one, wouldn’t ask
him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I would. The only thing is that perhaps
father wouldn’t like it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know he wouldn’t.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’s to be done, then? Are we to
spend our time hunting these blessed hens
until the day we die? If so’—tragically—‘I
hope that day will come full soon. Oh, I
declare, there’s the cock! Run, Susan, run!
Oh, the villain! the ringleader! Catch him,
Susan! Oh, there, he’s gone under the
laurels! Oh, the artful thing!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No he isn’t,’ cries Susan; ‘he’s over there,
near you. I see his leg. This side—this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>side, Betty. Ah, now you have him! Hold
him—hold him tight.’ Betty has caught
hold of the king of the yard, and is dragging
him ruthlessly from his hiding-place. There
are yells from the cock, and muttered execrations
from Betty. But finally the cock has
the best of it. With a whir and a whoop
he makes a last grand sprint, and once again
knows the splendours of freedom.</p>

<p class='c004'>Away he goes down the garden-path, and
away go the girls after him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Squawk, squawk, squawk!’ cries the cock;
and ‘Oh, if I catch you!’ cries Betty, under
her breath. Her breath is, indeed, running
very short. Susan’s has given way entirely.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, he is going to the tennis-ground!’
shrieks Betty distractedly; and, indeed, the
cock, with a view of circumventing the enemy,
is making for that broad course.</p>

<p class='c004'>At the rustic gateway, however, that leads
to it from the garden, a third enemy appears
upon the scene—an enemy that takes off his
hat, and makes such a magnificent attack
with it that the cock, disheartened, gives way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>in turn, retreats, <i><span lang="fr">chassés</span></i> a little, and finally,
with a wild skirl, swoops over the garden
wall after his wives, and is gone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It was a famous victory!’ cries Mr. Crosby,
when the defeat of the cock is beyond doubt.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is looking at Susan. Such a lovely,
flushed, and laughter-filled Susan! A Susan
with soft locks flying into her beauteous
eyes. A Susan with soft parted lips, and
breath coming in little merry gasps.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You were just in time,’ cries she, running
up to him, with happy <i><span lang="fr">camaraderie</span></i> in her
smile. ‘But for you, we should have been
hunting him all over the place. What lucky
fortune brought you at this moment?’—smiling
blandly into his eyes and giving him
her hand. ‘Just happening to be passing
by?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, I was coming to see you all,’ says
Crosby. He has nearly stopped at the
‘you,’ but she looks so young, so without a
thought behind her, that he feels it would be
useless. She would not understand, and even
if she did it would only annoy her. A girl
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>of the world—that would be different. She
would laugh at this suggestion of a flirtation;
but Susan—</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, come and see us all,’ says Betty
gaily. ‘We’re all round the corner, I fancy.’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, most of them are, the children
in the far distance chasing butterflies with a
net just constructed by Dom, whilst he and
Carew are listening with apparently engrossed
interest to their aunt, who, with
curls shaking and an air of general excitement
about her, is holding forth.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that you at last, Susan?’ says she,
shaking her curls more vigorously than ever.
‘Where have you been?—How d’ye do, Mr.
Crosby?—I must say, Susan, you are never
to be found when wanted.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The hens got into the garden,’ begins
Susan, colouring a little beneath this rebuke
uttered before Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, hens! What are hens,’ cries Miss
Barry tragically, ‘when human beings are
dying?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dying?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>‘Yes. I’ve just been to see poor dear Miss
Blake, and I really believe she is at death’s
door.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, I am sorry!’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She’s been at that uncomfortable portal
for the past year,’ says Betty, with distinct
scorn. ‘In my opinion, it would take a lot
of pushing to make her pass it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Elizabeth, this frivolity is absolutely disgraceful,’
says Miss Barry, directing a withering
glance at Betty, who, it must be said,
bears up beneath it with the utmost fortitude.
‘Dr. Mulcahy was with her. I’ve always
thought him a distinctly vulgar person, and
really, after what he said of poor Miss Blake
to-day, I feel justified in my opinion.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What did he say, auntie?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hardly like to repeat it. An insult to
a poor dying creature seems impossible,
doesn’t it, Mr. Crosby? But I heard him
myself. After all, why should not I speak?
One ought to expose monsters. My dear’—to
Susan—‘Lady Millbank had called to ask
how Miss Blake was—at least, I suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>it was for that purpose—but she mumbles so,
on account of those false teeth of hers, no
doubt, that I scarcely heard what she was
saying. But I did hear what Dr. Mulcahy
said to her a moment afterwards. He was
speaking of poor dear Kate Blake, and I
distinctly heard him say she was “low”!’
Miss Barry pauses dramatically, but, beyond
a smothered sound from Dom, nothing is
heard.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Aren’t you shocked, Susan, or must I
believe that the young people of this generation
are devoid of feeling. A Mulcahy to
call a Blake “low”! It struck me as so
abominable a piece of impertinence that I
went away on the instant. I don’t know, of
course, how Lady Millbank took it, but I
hope she put down that insolent man without
hesitation. Fancy a Blake being called
“low”! Why, poor dear Kate! she is as
well born as ourselves.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, auntie—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense, my dear! Don’t talk to me.
You children would find an excuse for anyone.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>‘It was only that I think he meant that
she was not so very well—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Born? Not so well born as the rest of
us? You must be mad, Susan! A creature
like Dr. Mulcahy to talk of birth at all
is absurd. Why, his father was a draper in
Dublin. But that he should cavil at Kate
Blake’s birth is outrageous. Why, the
Blakes—’ She stops, as if overcome by
wrath, and Dom takes up the parable.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought you knew, Susan,’ says he
reproachfully, but in a cautious tone, heard
only by the youngsters of the party, ‘that it
was poor Miss Blake’s forefather who planted
that tree of good and evil over which Adam
came such a cropper.’</p>

<p class='c004'>After this it is a relief to everybody when
Miss Barry, with a singularly brief farewell
to Crosby, betakes herself to the house. It
is quite as well she has gone so soon, as Carew
and Dominick were in the last stages of convulsive
laughter, and could not certainly
have held out much longer.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I say, isn’t Aunt Jemima a regular corker?’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>says Dom presently, addressing everybody in
general.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She didn’t understand,’ says Susan, who
feels a little sorry that her aunt should
appear in so poor a light before a man like
Crosby, who is, of course, accustomed to a
fashionable world and its ways.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think she has a very kind heart,’ says
he promptly, seeing her distress and smothering
the laughter that is consuming him. ‘Of
course, she had no idea that the doctor was
alluding to Miss Blake’s state of health.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You knew,’ says Susan, with a touch of
indignation, turning to Carew. ‘Why didn’t
you make it clear to her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, indeed?’ retorts he. ‘You tried to
do it, and how did you come off? Catch me
explaining her mistakes to Aunt Jemima.
More kicks than ha’pence for my pains.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Bonnie has come over to Susan, and, casting
his crutches aside, has slipped into her
arms, his head upon her knee—a head that
she strokes softly, softly, until at last the
little lad falls fast asleep.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>‘He had such a bad night,’ says Susan, as
Crosby now comes up and seats himself
beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I expect that means that you had a bad
night too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no’—reddening—‘I—I’m all right.
But he—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seems absurd,’ says Crosby suddenly,
‘that a child like that should be a prey to
rheumatism? Are you sure the doctors have
told you all the truth?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But are they reliable authorities?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m afraid so,’ says Susan, sighing. ‘But’—gently—‘don’t
let me trouble you with
our sorrows; tell me of yourself. Your sister
is coming, you say.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For my birthday. Yes, next month.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your birthday?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I told you, didn’t I? It will be in a few
days now.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A few days!’ Susan’s voice is low, as
usual, but primed with a curiosity that she
has much difficulty in suppressing.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>‘The third of August. It always makes
me feel like Ah Sin, Bret Harte’s Chinee—soft,
you know. Katherine is coming for the
great occasion. That’s my sister’s name,
Katherine. You will like her, I think.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is she like you?’ asks Susan.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Not a bit,’ says he, shaking his head.
‘Just the reverse. She is young and
skittish, whilst I am old and dull.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not dull,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Lazy, then. That comes of age, too, you
know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You weren’t too lazy to hunt the hens
just now,’ says Susan, as if combating some
disagreeable remembrances; ‘and you weren’t
too lazy to mount a ladder a month or
so ago.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, Susan, that’s unkind! You shouldn’t
hold up my past misdeeds to me. If you do,
I’ll hold up your indiscretions to you—your
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>lengthened conversation with a thief, for
example. You know you did think me a
thief then.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan makes a gesture.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes, you did; there is no getting out
of that. You even made me promise never
to steal again. And I haven’t, not so much
as the proverbial pin. That’s good of me,
isn’t it? Shows signs of grace, eh? Really,
Susan, I think you might say something.
Give me one word of encouragement. But
perhaps you don’t believe in my reformation.
I know ever since that day when I was
stealing the cherries you have had the lowest
opinion of me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish you wouldn’t talk like that,’ says
Susan, her charming brows drawing together;
‘it is very stupid of you, and you know you
don’t mean a word of it. Stealing! How
could you steal your own cherries? What
nonsense it all is! If you have nothing
better to say than that, you’—with a
sudden and most unusual discourtesy—‘had
better go away.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>‘Never; wild horses wouldn’t draw me
from this,’ says Crosby. ‘I’ll say something
“better” at once. I’m sure you have
the highest opinion of me. Will that do,
and may I stay now?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan gives him a glance from under her
long lashes that is still a little resentful—a
very little—but she says nothing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Must I go, then?’ says Crosby. ‘I
wouldn’t have believed it of you, Susan, to
send a poor lonely creature adrift like this.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are not so very lonely,’ says she.
She gives him another lovely, half-angry
glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am indeed. There is not a soul to
speak to me when I go back to my silent
home, and hours must elapse before I can
with any decency go to bed. Susan, be
merciful. Let me stay here and talk to you
of—’ He stops.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of what?’ says Susan, still eminently
distrustful. ‘What are you going to talk
about? That last thing—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll never mention cherries again.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>‘You must keep to that. And now’—lifting
her face and smiling at him in a little
fugitive way—‘go on about your sister. You
haven’t told me anything about her except
her name. Katherine, is it not?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Katherine Forster.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mrs. Forster?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, Lady Forster. She married one of
the Forsters of Berkshire. The eldest one,
George Forster, is a very good chap; you’ll
like him too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan had grown thoughtful. Dim recollections
of the Forsters as being extraordinarily
wealthy people have come home
to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think I told you that Katherine is
coming here to celebrate my birthday?’ says
Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; but your birthday—when is it?’
asks Susan, anxious to know when these
alarming visitors are to arrive.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The third of August. Didn’t I tell you?
Katherine likes to think she is coming here
to do me honour on that day; that’s how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>she puts it in words. To turn my house
upside down, however, is what she really
means. But I submit. The old house will
stand it. She isn’t half bad, really, and
certainly not more than half mad. I think
I told you you would like her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan, who has begun to quake
at the brother’s description of his sister.
‘And she will be here—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In about ten days’ time. George—that’s
her husband—is a first-class shot, and this
place has been pretty well preserved, in spite
of its absentee landlord. I hope he will enjoy
himself. Katherine is bringing a lot of her
friends with her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hers?’ Susan’s tone is a little faint. If
only this big society dame’s friends—what
is going to happen? Mr. Crosby is so kind
that he will be sure to make his sister ask
her up to the Hall. And how could she
(Susan) hold her own with these clever
people of the world, people who—</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby breaks into her silent fears.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hers principally; but some of them are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>mine, too, in a way. I really am so little at
home that I haven’t time to cultivate lifelong
friendships; but Lady Muriel Kennedy I
have known all my life, and liked. I hope’—suddenly—‘when
Katherine comes, you
will spare her a little of your time.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are very kind. If you would care to
have me,’ falters Susan disjointedly. Her
eyes are on the ground. To spare Lady
Forster a little of her time! As if Lady
Forster would even care to know her! How
could she (Susan) make herself at home with
people like that—people who had lived in
fashionable circles all their days—frivolous
people like Lady Forster, and lovely people
like Lady Muriel Kennedy? Had he called
Lady Muriel lovely?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is begging the question,’ says he,
laughing. ‘Who wouldn’t care to have you?
How silent you are, Susan! Not a word
out of you. I’ll begin to think you are in
love presently. People in love are always
silent, dwelling on the beloved absent, no
doubt.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>‘I am not in love,’ says Susan, with
singular distinctness.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not even with “James”? I forget his
other name. He would be a beloved absent,
wouldn’t he?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Absent or present, he would not be beloved
by me,’ says Susan calmly. She pauses.
Her head is slightly turned from Crosby, so
that only the perfect profile can be seen.
The fingers of her right hand are lying
tenderly on Bonnie’s sleeping head. The
fingers of the left are plucking idly at the
grass by her side.</p>

<p class='c004'>All at once she turns her glance straight
on Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Were you ever in love?’ asks she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Crosby seriously, ‘I don’t
think you ought to spring things upon one
like that. My heart may be weak, for all
you know; and, really, I begin to think of
late that it is.’ He pauses. Susan remaining
sternly unsympathetic, however, over
this leading speech, he goes on. ‘What was
your question?’ asks he.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>This sounds like basest subterfuge, and
Susan casts a glance of scorn at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I asked you if you had ever been in love.
Please don’t answer if you don’t want to.
After all, I am sure I should not have asked
you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You can ask me anything you like,’ says
Crosby with resignation. ‘Yours is to command,
mine to obey. Yes’—comfortably, if
surreptitiously, disposing himself on the tail
of Susan’s gown—‘I acknowledge it. I have
had my little disappointment. It was a
frightful affair. I don’t believe anyone was
ever so much in love as I was—then. I was
just twenty-one, and she was just—something
or other. It’s bad to remember a
lady’s age. Any way, I know I loved her—I
loved her,’ says Crosby, rising now to tragedy,
‘like anything. I can’t even at this hour
speak of it without tears.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, nonsense! you’re laughing,’ says
Susan, with fine disgust.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not, indeed. It is hysterics. If
only you had gone through half what I have,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>I might expect a little sympathy from you.
However, to continue. She was lovely,
Susan, and she was tall—taller than you.
She had coal-black eyes, and a nose that I
have always considered Roman. I adored
her. I used to walk about o’ nights looking
at the moon (when there was one), and telling
myself it was the image of her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The image of her! I must say I think
you were hardly complimentary,’ says Susan,
who seems to be on the look-out for slips.
‘There is nothing in the moon but a man,
and a hideous one too—just like the clown at
the circus.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘True’—reflectively. ‘Then it couldn’t
have been the moon I compared her to.
Perhaps’—thoughtfully—‘it was a star.
Ah!’—joyfully—‘that’s it—my own particular
star. See?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Susan contemptuously; and
then: ‘I don’t believe you ever compared
her to anything.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I did—I did indeed, even quite lately,’
says Crosby. But this ambiguous speech
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>receiving no recognition, he goes on: ‘If,
as your contemptuous silence evidently
means, Susan, you think me incapable of
love, you are greatly in the wrong. I assure
you I did compare her to that star. There
was one special one; but somehow I can’t
find it lately. It must have been removed, I
think. And besides the star, I remember
quite well being under a hallucination that
led me to believe that the wettest day under
heaven was full of sunshine when she was
present; and that when she wasn’t present,
no matter how brilliant the sky might be,
that the sun never shone. Come, now,
Susan; be just. That was real love, wasn’t
it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I really don’t know,’ says Susan. There
is a slight pause; then: ‘Go on.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Go on?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did she die?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Die? Not much,’ says Crosby cheerfully.
‘Though of course’—relapsing into very suspicious
gloom—‘she was dead to me. She’—with
deep melancholy—‘thought I couldn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>furnish a house up to her form, so she threw
me over.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What an odious girl!’ says Susan. For
the first time a spark of sorrow for him
lights her eyes. She flushes softly with
most genuine indignation. Crosby looks
at her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was a very pretty girl,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘For all that’—quickly—‘you must hate
her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On the contrary, I think I love her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s face grows disdainful.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Even more than ever I did.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are very constant.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s the first compliment you ever paid
me. But to end my tale—I saw her in town
last March.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes?’ Susan has lifted her flower-like
face, and is gazing at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You met her? And she—she—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Was a widow.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A widow; and so you and she.... It is
quite a romance!’ says Susan, in her soft
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>voice, speaking hurriedly, almost stammering,
indeed, in what is perhaps her joyful
excitement over this beautiful ending to a
sad love-story. ‘And she was as beautiful
as ever?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, hardly,’ said Crosby slowly, as if
recalling a late picture to mind. ‘She is
now, I am sorry to say, all angles. She was
once plump. Her nose struck me as anything
but Roman now; and her eyes were
blacker than ever—I wonder who blacks
them?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yet when you saw her, you must have
thought of the past. You must have—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are quite right: I thought strongly
of the past. I thought of nothing else. I
said to myself: “At this moment this woman
might have been your wife, but for—” I
forget the rest—I believe I fainted. When
I recovered I knew I loved her as I had never
loved her before. She had refused me!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose that’s what people call cynicism?’
says Susan, regarding him with open
distrust.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>‘I don’t know what any other fellow would
call it,’ says Crosby mildly. ‘I only know
that I call it a blessed relief. I felt quite
kindly towards her, and went forthwith and
bought her tickets for something or other,
and sent them to her with a line, saying I
was going to Africa for ten years. But
there’s no more animosity. I look upon her
now as a woman who has done me a really
good turn.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think,’ says Susan, with sweet
seriousness, ‘that you ought to speak of her
like that. I dare say she was really very
fond of you, but if you were both very poor
how could you be married?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is that the view you take of it?’ says
Crosby. ‘What a mercenary one! And
from a child like you! Susan, I’m ashamed
of you!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no, you know what I mean,’ says
Susan, blushing divinely whilst making her
defence. ‘There might be unkind people
behind her, you know, forbidding her to
marry you.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Crosby stops, and his thoughts run swiftly
to the mysterious ‘James.’ Were there unkind
people behind her when that gallant
youth declared his passion?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Might there? And if there were, should
she listen, do you think?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah, some would,’ says Susan, speaking
out of the great wealth of worldly lore that
can be gathered from eighteen years of life.
‘But others’—thoughtfully—‘wouldn’t.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To which section do you belong?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, me! I don’t know,’ says Susan, growing
suddenly very shy. ‘I shouldn’t do anything—I—I
should wait.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Would you?’ says Crosby. There is
something in the girl’s soft young face, now
lowered and turned from him, so full of gentle
strength that he wonders at it. Yes, she
would wait for her lad—‘Though father, an’
mither, an’ a’ should go mad.’ Is she waiting
for James?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m afraid, after all, I must destroy your
illusion,’ says he presently. ‘I don’t think
she could have been in love with me. Not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>overpoweringly, I mean. She had a little
money of her own, and I had a little of
mine, so that we should not have been altogether
paupers. But she was dreadfully
addicted to diamonds, and man milliners, and
bibelots of all kinds. I have other reasons,
too, Susan, for thinking she did not really
love me. She never gave me a keepsake!
Now you—you have had a keepsake.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby!’ Susan’s face is crimson.
‘I wish—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know. I beg your pardon. Of course
I should not have mentioned it. But you
and I are old friends now, Susan; and somehow
it is permissible for me to confide to you
the hollow fact that no one ever gave me a
silver brooch with—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan lifts Bonnie’s head gently, and shows
a dignified, but most determined, desire to rise.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t,’ says Crosby quickly. ‘You’ll
wake him.’ He points to Bonnie’s lovely
little head, and Susan pauses in her flight.
‘Besides, I shan’t say another word—not
one. I swear it. What I really wanted
was your compassion. I have never had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>a keepsake given me in all my life, save
one.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Surely one is enough,’ says Susan slowly.
Curiosity, after a moment, overcomes her
dignity, and she says unwillingly: ‘Is it a
nice one?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I desire no nicer,’ says he. He pulls his
watch from his pocket, and on the chain close
to it—on a tiny silver ring of its own—hangs
a silver sixpence.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That! Only a sixpence!’ Susan’s voice
is rather uncertain. What sixpence is that?
She—she didn’t— ‘Of course,’ says she, ‘I
know a broken sixpence is a very usual thing
between lovers. But this— It is not
broken, and—and not old, either. I must
say when she gave you a keepsake she—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She hardly gave it,’ says Crosby. ‘She
only laid it on the last rung of a ladder that
led up to some—’</p>

<p class='c004'>That sentence is never finished. Bonnie’s
head is now lying on Susan’s rug. But Susan
herself is already far over there, her head
very high indeed, and her rage and her indignation
even higher.</p>

      <div class='line in6'>‘My love is like the sky—</div>
      <div class='line in6'>As distant and as high.</div>
      <div class='line'>Perchance she’s fair and kind and bright,</div>
      <div class='line'>Perchance she’s stormy, tearful quite—</div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘Is this Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby, standing at the little gate leading
into the Rectory garden, feels a spasm of
doubt. He has come down this morning to
make it up with her, as the children say,
after that slight quarrel of yester eve—a
quarrel that was all on her side. Her remorseless
refusal to bid him good-bye had
left him a little desolate.</p>

<p class='c004'>Is that really the sedate Susan, that
slender nymph flying over there in the
distance—racing, rather—with Tommy, as a
willing prey, running before her?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Crosby has, through time, grown accustomed
to think of Susan as a demure maiden,
slightly Puritan in type, though no doubt
with a latent wilfulness lying beneath the
calm exterior. But now that the latent wilfulness
has broken loose, he finds himself unprepared
for it. Susan running there in the
sunshine, with her hair, apparently just out of
the tub and hardly yet dry, floating behind
her, is another creature altogether. And
such hair, too! Such glorious waves on
waves glinting golden in the sun’s bright
rays, with Susan’s face peeping out of it now
and then. How wild, how mad, how soft, the
bright hair looks, and how sweet are the
ringing cries that come from Susan’s parted
lips!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The bear has you, Tommy. He’s coming.
He’—making a dab at the excited Tommy—‘will
have you soon. In another moment
he’ll be on you, tearing you—’ Quite a
sprint here on the part of Tommy, and increased
speed accordingly on Susan’s part.
‘And his claws are sharp—sharp!’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Tommy, in his flight, turns terrified eyes
on Susan over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Susan, don’t, don’t!’ shrieks he, filled
with joy and terror. The terror constitutes
three-fourths of the joy. And now he flies
again for his life, the deadly bear, the ruthless
pursuer, dashing after him with relentless
energy.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby, watching, tells himself, with a
somewhat grim smile, that it is Tommy
alone who would flee from such a delightful
enemy. Perhaps his thoughts are touched
with a tinge of disappointment at finding
Susan in this mad mood. Yesterday she had
seemed to him angered and disturbed when
she left him so abruptly; and he had gone
home with a growing sense of contrition
strong upon him. It had been strong enough
to bring him down this morning with half a
dozen apologies, to find that she has forgotten
all about this offence and—him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Here lies the real sting. The Susan he
had imagined as being a little out of joint
with her world—just a very little daintily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>offended with him—is not the Susan who is
here now, and who is running round the
garden in merry pursuit of her little brother,
with her eyes gleaming like diamonds, and
evidently as gay as a lark.</p>

<p class='c004'>She is close on Tommy now. She has put
out a hand to grasp him, but Tommy is full
of enterprise, doubles like a hare, and is now
rushing frantically towards the gate on
which Crosby is leaning.</p>

<p class='c004'>This brings Susan, who is still in hot pursuit
of him, with her face towards Crosby.
Now more distinctly he can see her. What
a lovely, perfect child she is, with her
loose hair floating behind her, like that of
the immortal ‘Damosel,’ and the little soft
gasping laughs coming from her open lips!
<i><span lang="fr">Joie de vivre</span></i> is written in every line of
her face and every curve of her lissom body.</p>

<p class='c004'>All at once, even as he watches her, this
joy dies out of her face. ‘She has seen me,’
says Crosby to himself; and forthwith he
opens the gate and advances towards her.
Tommy, in his race, has reached him, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>now, breathless, flings himself into his arms,
turning to look, with affected fright, at the
coming of Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a very slow coming, and has evidently
something to do with her hair—as can be
seen through the branches of a big escallonia
on Crosby’s left. He determines to give her
time to struggle with that beautiful hair.
‘Tommy, you ought to fall on the gravel and
embrace your preserver’s knees,’ says he. ‘I
have evidently saved you from an untimely
death, if all I heard was true. I think, however,
that you might have warned me that
bears were about.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He is quite conscious, whilst speaking, that
Susan is still making frantic, but ineffectual,
efforts to do up her hair; so he goes on.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where’s your particular bear?’ asks he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Here,’ says Susan, as she steps in the
most unexpected fashion from behind the
tree. He can see that she is greatly disconcerted,
and that she would never have
come from behind it if remaining there
was any longer possible. But she had seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>and heard him, as he had seen and heard
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>She advances now, her expression cold and
unkindly, and her hands still struggling with
her hair, in her desire to reduce it to some
sort of reason.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why trouble yourself about it?’ says
Crosby. ‘It is the prettiest thing I ever
saw as it is.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is not pretty to me,’ says Susan crushingly.
Her arms are still above her head,
and, as she speaks to him, she weaves into a
superb coil the loose strands of her soft hair.
In spite of this, however, the little locks
around her brows, loosened and softened by
the late washing, are straying wildly, flying
here and there of their own sweet will, and
making an aureole round Susan’s head, out of
which her eyes gleam at Crosby with anything
but friendship in them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How d’ye do?’ says he blandly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How d’ye do?’ says Susan in return.
She lets her hand rest in his for the barest
moment, then withdraws it.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Crosby regards her reproachfully. ‘You
are angry with me still,’ says he. ‘And after
a whole night of reflection.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am not angry at all,’ says Susan. ‘Why
should you think so?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, you are,’ says Crosby. ‘I can see it
in your eyes. Your very hair is bristly.
And all because—’ He stops, as if afraid
to go on.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Because what?’ asks Susan, with a touch
of severity.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Because I once got sixpence out of you!’
He is not able to resist it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tommy,’ says Susan, ‘your collar is dirty,
and you must come back to the house with
me to get another.’ As she speaks she
catches Tommy, who has not yet got to the
years of civilization, and who hates clean
collars, and prepares to march him off.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Tommy,’ says Mr. Crosby, ‘wait a minute;
your sister won’t, but perhaps you will.
There is a photographer in town to-day; he
has come down from Dublin. And your aunt
says she would like to have some of you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>photographed.’ Here there is a distinct
slowing in Susan’s march past, though she
disdains to turn her head, or show further
mark of interest. ‘Don’t you want to be
photographed, Tommy? I do, badly.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What is it?’ asks Tommy, whose views
of amusement as a rule mean lollipops, and
those only, and who has no knowledge of
cameras or kodaks.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s painful, as a rule,’ says Crosby. ‘But
children seldom suffer. It’s only people of
my age who come out with their noses
twisted. Did you ever have your nose
twisted, Tommy? It hurts awfully, I can tell
you. But’—with a glance at Susan—‘other
things hurt worse. You ought to speak to
Susan, Tommy—to tell her that prolonged
cruelty sometimes ends in the death of the
victim.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Susan faces round. ‘What I
think is,’ says she, ‘that you ought to give
me back that horrid sixpence.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It isn’t horrid.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You should give it back, at all events.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>‘Oh, Susan, anything but that—my life
even.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’—with mounting indignation—‘can
you want it for, except to annoy me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is thy servant a slave? I want it as a
memento of the only occasion on record on
which I was called a “kind, kind man,” and
a “good” and an “honest” one besides.
You did call me all that, Susan. And yet,
now—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Heaven alone knows what would have
been the end of all this, but for the providential
appearance of Miss Barry and Betty
upon the scene.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Susan, have you heard? But,
of course, Mr. Crosby has told you. Good
gracious! what is the matter with your head,
child?’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, Susan’s hair has again found
freedom, and is flowing down her back in
happy, shining waves.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have just washed it,’ says Susan shamefacedly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An admirable deed,’ says Miss Barry, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>is in too great a state of delight to lecture
with her usual fluency, and who, indeed, feels
inclined to be lenient. ‘But you should not
come into publicity, my dear child, until it is
dry and carefully dressed again. However’—beaming
upon Crosby, who begins to quite
like her—‘youth will be youth, you know.
And what do you think, Susan? There is a
man down from the best photographer’s in
Dublin—from Chancellor’s, I believe. And
I am thinking of having our pictures taken,
if only to send some copies to your uncle
in Australia—my brother, you know, my
dear. He will be so pleased to get them;
and, really, it is a grand opportunity. Of
course, you, Mr. Crosby, have had yours
taken in every quarter of the globe, but we
country mice seldom get the chance of seeing
ourselves as others see us.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I haven’t been photographed for quite ten
years,’ says Crosby, ‘and I feel now as if it
were my duty to sit again. Miss Barry, if
you are going to be photographed to-day, will
you take me under your wing?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>‘I shall be pleased indeed,’ says Miss Barry,
with much dignity.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Won’t it be fun!’ cries Betty, clapping
her hands.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And the hour?’ asks Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘About two. What do you think, Susan?
Two would be a good hour, eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, a good hour,’ says Susan, without
interest. Then, suddenly: ‘Is—are you
going to have Bonnie taken?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Susan’—Miss Barry flushes the
dull pink of the old when shamed—‘why
should we send all our pictures to your uncle
at once? It—it would probably confuse him.
Another time we may think of that,’ says
Miss Barry, who has counted up all her available
shillings this morning, to see if it would
be possible to send all the children, but had
found they fell decidedly short. She would
have died, however, rather than confess this
to a stranger. ‘Just mine and yours, and—but
I am afraid your father will never consent
to be taken—and Betty’s and Carew’s—just
the eldest ones. You can see, Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>Crosby, that just the eldest ones will be
those most acceptable to their uncle.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I see,’ says Crosby. He has seen it
all, indeed. As if in a dream, Miss Barry’s
purse has been laid open to him and the contents
made bare. The two shillings for herself,
and the two for Susan, and for Betty,
and for Carew—eight shillings in all—and
after that nothing. He has seen, too, the
pride of the poor lady, who would not acknowledge
the want of means wherewith to
provide photos of the younger children for
their uncle abroad, but put her objection to
their being taken on the grounds of their
youth. He has seen, too, Susan’s face as she
hears that Bonnie is not to be taken. Oh,
the quick, pained disappointment of it!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At two, then,’ says he, ‘we shall meet at
the photographer’s.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; two sharp,’ says Miss Barry, who
seems quite excited. ‘Susan, I think I shall
wear my new lace cap.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think you ought to wear your hair just
as it is now,’ says Crosby to Susan in a low
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>tone, as he bids her good-bye. It is impossible
for her to refuse him her hand with
her aunt looking on; and though Crosby is
aware of this, it is to his shame, I confess,
that he takes it and holds it in a warm clasp
before he lets it go.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>‘Betty, was I looking frightful?’ asks
Susan, drawing her sister away as soon as
Crosby is out of sight. ‘Tell me quite the
truth. Don’t gloss things over just to please
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I won’t,’ says Betty, giggling. ‘I’ll be as
honest as the sun. You looked’—pausing
wickedly—‘something between Meg Merrilees
and a wild Indian, with a bias toward
the latter. But that needn’t put you out.
He’s accustomed to wild Indians; and when
one has lived with people fifty years or so,
one gets to admire them. I shouldn’t wonder
if he admired you. You must have taken
him back to the good old days. Why didn’t
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>you sing “Way down upon the Swannee
River” for him? That would have finished
the conquest.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You don’t seem to know what wild
Indians are,’ Susan remonstrates calmly.
‘They live in North America, and couldn’t
sing a nigger song to save their lives. You
don’t seem to know, either, that it was in
Africa that Mr. Crosby spent most of his
time, and that the blacks there aren’t
niggers at all.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it’s all the same,’ says Betty airily.
‘A black’s a black for a’ that; and if they
don’t sing one thing, they sing another. And
any way, I could see by the gleam in Mr.
Crosby’s eye, as he looked at you and your
flowing locks, that he loves wildness in every
form.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan is silent for a time; then:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Betty’—in a low tone—‘how old do you
think he is?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think he has beaten Methuselah
yet, if you mean that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; but really, I mean how old, eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>‘Well’—carefully—‘allowing him the fifty
years he spent with his blacks, and the fact
that he told us that he started at twenty-three
on an adventurous career, he must be
now well into the seventies.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan’s laugh—so evidently expected here—sounds
to herself a little forced, though
why she could not have explained.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not so old as that!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, perhaps not, by a year or so,’ says
Betty, as if determined on being absolutely
fair and accurate to a fraction.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Do you know,’ says Susan, a little reluctantly,
but as though she must say it, ‘I—of
course, I know he is ever so much older
than any of us, but, for all that, somehow, he
doesn’t seem to me to be—well, old, you
know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Betty nods, and Susan, encouraged by
this treacherous sign, rashly takes a further
step.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It has even sometimes seemed to me,’
says she nervously, ‘that he is quite young.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That reminds me of something I read this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>morning,’ says Betty, who is beginning to
enjoy herself. ‘It ran like this: “On the
whole, I consider him one of the youngest
men of my acquaintance.”’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Where did you read that?’ asks Susan,
with open suspicion.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘In a book’—smartly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I suppose so. And what book, and
who said it?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A frisky duchess.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She was young, of course?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not very,’ Betty grins. ‘Eighty-two
or thereabouts.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, well, then, no doubt she was alluding
to a mere boy of her acquaintance.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not at all. To another frisky person of
the opposite sex—a young thing of one
hundred and five or so.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What do you mean, Betty? You don’t
suppose that Mr. Crosby is a hundred and
five or so?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t indeed. I put him in the seventies,
if you remember. That would make him
quite a babe to the duchess I speak of.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>She said her centenarian had the brightest,
the most engaging manners, and, of course,
that reminded me of Mr. Cros— Where
are you going now, Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I want to put fresh cuffs on Bonnie’s
shirts,’ says Susan. Her tone is a little
reserved, and there is a deepening of dignity
in the delicate lightness of her steps, as she
turns away, that tells Betty she is in some
way offended.</p>

<p class='c004'>Betty, stricken, but with a conscience clear,
runs after her and tucks her arm into hers.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Have I vexed you?’ asks she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Vexed me?’ Susan’s tone is rather
exaggerated. ‘No. How could you have
vexed me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s true,’ says Betty comfortably, who
never gets deeper than the actual moment.
‘Then I’ll come with you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But why should I bring you in?’ asks
Susan, who has a new queer fancy to be
alone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To do your hair, for one thing,’ says the
tease of the family with delightful <i><span lang="fr">bonhomie</span></i>.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>‘Really, Susan, you can’t appear in public
like this twice; and you know we are going
to be photographed in— What is the
hour now? Good gracious! it’s growing
very late. We must run. Bonnie’s shirts
can’t be done to-day, but I’ll help you with
them to-morrow. Oh, there’s auntie—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, you must make haste,’ cries Miss
Barry, hurrying round the corner. ‘There is
no time to be lost. And, my dear, your
hair! How fortunate you washed it to-day!
When neatly done up it will look beautiful.
Betty, I have been thinking of having you
taken with your hat on. Your best hat—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, auntie!’ says poor Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; well, perhaps not. What do you
think, Susan?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think she would look nicer without it,’
says Susan, in answer to an agonized glance
from Betty. ‘And you, auntie? I think
we ought to put a fresh bow in your cap;
that side one is always falling down. You
have a little bit of ribbon, haven’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I think so; in the top drawer,’ says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Miss Barry. ‘Susan’—suddenly—‘how could
you ask such an uncomfortable question
before Mr. Crosby!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What question?’ asks Susan, turning very
red.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, as to whether I was going to have
Bonnie photographed. I was quite taken
aback,’ says Miss Barry, shaking her curls;
‘and, indeed, it was only the natural <i><span lang="fr">savoir
faire</span></i> that belongs to me’—to give Miss
Barry’s Parisian accent would pass the wit
of man—‘that enabled me to conquer the
situation. You might be quite sure, Susan,
that if I had the money Bonnie and Tommy
too should have been sent to their dear uncle.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I see, auntie. I am sorry,’ says Susan,
with honest, deep regret.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose,’ says Miss Barry, with the air
of one addressing a forlorn hope, ‘that you
and Betty have nothing?’</p>

<p class='c004'>It is plain that the poor lady had set her
heart originally on having a ‘full set’ to
send to the uncle abroad, but that reasons
financial have crushed her hopes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>‘I have only sixpence,’ says Susan sadly.
‘You, Betty?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I spent the twopence I had yesterday,’
says Betty, ‘on hairpins.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hairpins!’ cries Miss Barry indignantly.
‘And your hair not up yet!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They were for Susan,’ explains Betty
angrily, who had, indeed, bought them for
Susan, but who, nevertheless, had spent an
enjoyable hour with them, doing up her own
hair, and seeing how she would look next
year when ‘grown up.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, that’s the end of it,’ says Miss
Barry, with the courage of despair. ‘I certainly
won’t ask your father for a penny, as
I know he hasn’t one to spare this month;
and, indeed’—sighing—‘I only hope that
those reports about that bank in Scotland are
untrue. It is in that he has invested the
£500 he has laid aside for Carew—for his
crammer, you know, and his outfit, and all
the rest of it. I dare say the scare will come
to nothing; but, at all events, he is a little
pressed just now, so that for a mere luxury
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>like this I think we had better not ask him
for anything.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of course not,’ says Susan. ‘But, auntie’—slowly
and a little nervously—‘would you
mind very much if—if Bonnie had his picture
taken instead of me? I have always so
longed for one of his. He is so delicate,
and—’ She stops suddenly, a terrible
feeling in her throat forbidding another
word.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Susan! And you the eldest!
Why, it would be quite an insult to your
dear uncle. No, no,’ says Miss Barry; ‘we
must depend upon another time to get
Bonnie and Tom taken.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns away. Will there ever be
‘another time’ for Bonnie? So frail in the
warm summer-time, how will it be with him
when the snows and the frosts set in?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘At all events, I think I will take him
down with me to see the rest of us taken,’
she says presently in a depressed voice. ‘It
will amuse and interest him. You know how
clever he is.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>‘Yes, by all means, and I’ll take Tommy,’
says Betty, ‘though goodness knows if after
that we shall any of us come out alive.’</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Susan has started very early (it is only ten
minutes after one), so as to give Bonnie
plenty of time to get down to the village
without fatigue. Miss Ricketty will give
him a seat in her place; a penny out of the
last sixpence will buy him a cake or some
sweets; and then, with a little rest, he can
easily go on to the room rented to the photographer
by Mr. Salter, the hardware Methodist.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has now reached Miss Ricketty’s,
and has been welcomed by that excellent
if slightly eccentric spinster with open arms.
Bonnie is literally in her arms—and now is
ensconced in the cosiest corner of this cosy
little shop, behind the tiny gateway. Indeed,
Miss Ricketty is preparing in a surreptitious
manner to bring down a jar of unspeakably
beautiful bull’s-eyes for Bonnie’s delectation,
when Susan intervenes.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>‘No—no indeed, dear Miss Ricketty.
He has a penny of his own to-day. And he
loves buying. Don’t you, Bonnie? Another
day, perhaps. And I think a cake would
be better for him, don’t you? You would
rather have a Queen cake, Bonnie darling,
wouldn’t you?’—appealingly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Bonnie, out of the sweetness of
his nature, seeing she desires it, though his
soft eyes are dwelling on the lollipops. But
that he can’t have both is a foregone conclusion,
as Susan tells herself with a sigh.
The remaining fivepence will have to do
many things until next week, when father
will give her her tiny weekly allowance
again. Besides, a cake is ever so much
better for him than bull’s-eyes. Thus Susan
consoles herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you goin’ to be took, Miss Susan?’
asks Miss Ricketty, settling herself, as she
calls it, for a good chat.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan laughs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not by the sergeant, any way,’ says
she.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>‘Ah, ye will have yer joke now. An’, sure,
I’m a silly old fool. But ye’re goin’ to have
yer picture done, aren’t ye? Fegs, ’twould
be a shame if ye didn’t. ’Tis a mighty purty
picture would be lost to the world if you held
back. Why, all the world is crowdin’ to that
man’s door. I saw Lady Millbank go in just
now. An’ at her time o’ life! Law, the
vanity o’ some folk! D’ye know what me
brother said to me to-day?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What?’ asks Susan, who is growing
interested.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Whether I wouldn’t like to see me own
face on a card. An’ I tould  him as I had
seen it for sixty years in a lookin’-glass, an’
that was good enough for me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, Miss Ricketty,’ says Susan, seeing
with her delicate sense of sympathy beneath
the veil that conceals Miss Ricketty’s real
desire to be ‘seen on a card,’ ‘why not be
taken? It would not give you pleasure,
perhaps, but see what pleasure it would give
to others. And as for me, I should love a
photograph of you.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>‘Oh now, Miss Susan! Sure, ye know, ye
wouldn’t care for a picture of the likes of
me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should like it more than I can say,’
says Susan. ‘Miss Ricketty’—with pretty
entreaty— ‘you really must make up your
mind to it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I’ll be thinkin’—I’ll be thinkin’,’
says Miss Ricketty, who is all agog with
excitement and flattery. ‘I suppose, Miss
Susan dear, that shawl they sent me from
America would be too bright?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The very thing,’ says Susan. ‘It would
be lovely. And your people in America will
certainly recognise it, and it will give them
great pleasure to know that you treasure it
so highly.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There’s a lot in that,’ says Miss Ricketty,
musing—she muses considerably. ‘Well, perhaps—’
Here she pauses again. ‘It may
be,’ says she at last. She might, perhaps,
have condescended to explain this last oracular
speech, but that her bright eye catches
sight of three young ladies going past her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>window. ‘There they go! there they go!
Look at them, Miss Susan, my dear! Did ye
ever see such quare crathures? May the
Vargin give them sense! Look at their hats,
an’ the strut o’ them! They’ve a power
o’ money, I’m tould. “Articles of virtue”
Mr. Connor called them the last day he was
in here; but, faith, where the virtue comes
in—they do say— But that’s not talk
for the likes o’ you or me, dear. But tell
me now, Miss Susan, what of Mr. Crosby?
I’ve heard that he— Oh, murdher! talk of
the divil—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Ricketty retires behind a huge jar of
sweets as Crosby comes into the shop.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crosby looks a little surprised at finding
Susan here.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How d’ye do?’ again says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan, without enthusiasm, gives him her
hand. She is busy wondering what could
have brought him in here, of all places. Fond
of chocolates, perhaps.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Why, there you are, Bonnie,’ says Mr.
Crosby gaily. ‘No wonder I didn’t see you
in that nice big chair. How d’ye do, Miss
Ricketty? I hope you have been behaving
yourself properly since last I saw you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Mr. Crosby!’ The old maid shakes
her head at him with delight.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>‘No fresh flirtations, I trust.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, hear to him!’ Miss Ricketty is
laughing like a girl.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And how is the giant?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Me brother is very well, thank you, sir.
An’ he wants to see ye badly about that
cricket match in the park. They say that
Tim Murphy is goin’ to be very troublesome
over it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit of it. Tell your brother that
I’ve squared the militant Tim, and that he
will turn up all right. What charming
sweets, Bonnie! I love sweets; don’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He has made a sign to Miss Ricketty, who
is now making up a splendid parcel.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Bonnie has had a cake,’ says Susan. She
would have said a great deal more if Tommy
had been in question. Indeed, then she
would have refused distinctly; but Bonnie’s
little lovely smiling face, and the joy she
knows it will give the gentle child to share
Mr. Crosby’s gift with his little brother, stops
her. She says nothing more, though it is
actual pain to her to have to accept these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>sweets for her brother from Crosby. It is a
debt she owes to Bonnie to suffer thus. But,
then, what does she not owe Bonnie?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘L’appétit vient en mangeant,’ says Crosby.
‘Miss Ricketty, don’t be in such a hurry to
tie up that parcel. Bonnie and I want something
out of it first.’ He puts a delightful
box of chocolate creams on Bonnie’s knee as
he speaks, then turns to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose I daren’t offer you anything,’
says he, in a low tone. Miss Ricketty becomes
at once absorbed in a bottle of bull’s-eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Susan gently, ‘thank you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not even an apology?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan glances quickly at him, and then
hesitates. Perhaps she would have said
something, but at this moment Miss Barry,
with Betty and Dom and Carew, enter the
shop.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We saw you through the window,’ cries
Betty; and suddenly Susan’s thoughts run
riot. Had he seen her through the window?
‘And so we came in. We must hurry, Susan;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>all the world is going to have its picture
taken—even Lady Millbank, though goodness
alone knows why. And such a guy as she
looks in that velvet mantle—that heavy
thing—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A regular overmantle,’ says Dom.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Bless me!’ says Miss Barry suddenly,
breaking off her conversation with Miss
Ricketty over the proper treatment of young
fowls when they come to be three months old.
‘Susan, you and Betty are wearing the same
frocks.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, it was I who arranged that,’ says
Betty calmly. ‘In some way, Susan and
I have never worn these frocks together
before, and I have heard that those old
Murphy girls—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not the Murphys, Betty—the Stauntons,’
says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It doesn’t matter; they are all old maids
alike,’ says Betty lightly. ‘Any way, I have
heard that some of the weird women of
Curraghcloyne have said that we were short
of clothes, because Susan and I had only one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>dress between us. This’—smoothing down her
pretty serge frock—‘is the one in question.
So I’m going to be photographed with Susan
in it, if only to upset their theories, and give
them some bad half-hours with their cronies;
cronies never spare one.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You and Susan are going to be photographed
together!’ says Miss Barry, who is
getting a stormy look in her eyes. ‘You
will not, then, be taken separately?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes,’ says Betty airily. ‘Separately,
too. I hate double pictures as a rule, but
when duty calls—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry is now making wild pantomimic
signs to Susan. ‘Stop her!’ her lips are
saying—‘stop her at all risks, or we shall be
eternally disgraced!’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, the poor lady had not another
penny to spend beyond what she had already
arranged for. If this double picture that the
rash and reckless Betty speaks of becomes an
accomplished fact, who is to pay for it? Not
Miss Barry, certainly, because she has nothing
with which to pay. And, naturally, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>photographer will demand his just fees, and
then all will come out, and—</p>

<p class='c004'>She is on the point of appealing to Miss
Ricketty, when Dom nudges her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s all right,’ whispers he. ‘I have
enough for that. I’ve settled it with Betty.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry gives him a grateful look,
greatly interspersed with rebuke. Such a
throwing away of good money! As if that
conceited child could not be satisfied with one
representation of her face! She must really
speak to Dom about his folly later—a little
later—on.</p>

<p class='c004'>It doesn’t seem folly at all to Dominick,
who is a most generous youth, if extravagant,
and who would give a great deal more to this
photographic business if it was in his power.
But a great deal has been spent of late on
cartridges for the murdering of Mr. Crosby’s
rabbits—so much, indeed, that cigarettes
have grown scarce and pipes a luxury, spite
of even the small sums that Carew has thrown
into the common fund. Carew has generally
a shilling or two in his pockets, the Rector
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>deeming it advisable to give to his eldest son,
out of his terribly inadequate income, a
certain amount of pocket-money, to prepare
him for the time when he will be thrown on
his own resources; to teach him to economize
now, so that when he is gazetted, and has to
rely on his own slender allowance, he will be
able to understand how to make money go as
far as it can.</p>

<p class='c004'>All through the boy’s educational course,
he had felt it a sort of madness to put him
into the army at all—a boy who must
necessarily live entirely on his pay—a forlorn
arrangement in these fast days, and one out
of which only ten per cent. rise successfully.
But the last wish of his dying wife had been
that Carew should enter the army. She had
come of a good fighting stock herself, poor
soul! to which she remained faithful, having
fought her own fight with poverty most
bravely until she died; and the Rector, who
had cared less and less for earthly things since
she had gone to heaven, had not the heart or
the strength to refuse that dying wish.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>‘You’re sure you have it?’ whispers back
Miss Barry to Dom.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certain.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then’—sharply—‘it would have been
much more to your credit if you had
kept it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To my credit, yes,’ says Dom.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A more disgraceful display of extravagance—’
Miss Barry, either from the
forced whispering or indignation, here grows
hoarse, and coughs a little, whereupon Miss
Ricketty, who is now intensely interested,
and is listening with all her might, holds out
to her a jar of jujubes; but Miss Barry waves
them off.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose it is the last penny?’ asks
she, still addressing Dom in a whisper, but
with a magisterial air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—nearly,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>The ‘nearly’ is a concession to the truth.
He has, indeed, three shillings left out of his
monthly allowance, but these are already
accounted for. They are to buy three copies
of Betty for his own special apartment—one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>to be hung up over his gun, one over his
bookcase, and one over his study table.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s the one you’ll never see,’ Betty had
said to him tauntingly, and most ungratefully,
when he told her of the decision he had come
to about his last three shillings.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry, now turning away from him
with a heart decidedly heavy, directs her
conversational powers on Crosby.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I congratulate you on being in good time,’
says she. ‘When Betty and I started, we
had great trouble in getting Carew and
Dominick to come with us. They were
dreadfully late, and we said then—Betty and
I—that you would surely be late. But you’—smiling
and wagging her curls—‘have
behaved splendidly. I do appreciate a young
man who can be punctual.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan glances quickly at her. ‘Young
man!’ Is she in earnest, and after all that
Betty had said?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Young man!’ Is he a young man? Well,
she has often thought so—she had even told
Betty so. Here she glances at Betty, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Betty is now enjoying a word-to-word dispute
with Dominick.</p>

<p class='c004'>Any way, she had told her. But Betty—what
does she know? She has declared
a man once over thirty, old. But Aunt
Jemima thinks otherwise. And really, when
one comes to think of it, Aunt Jemima at
times is very clever—almost deep, indeed;
and certainly very clever in her conclusions.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Look! there are the Blakes coming out,’
cries Betty suddenly; she is standing on
tiptoe at the window, which commands a fine
view of the entrance to the photographer’s.
‘Auntie, Susan, let us go, before any other
people come.’</p>

<p class='c004'>With this they all in a body cross the
road, Carew having caught up Bonnie, who
is all eagerness to see this wonderful thing
that will put Susan’s face on paper.</p>

<p class='c004'>Upstairs they march in a body, to find
themselves presently in a most evil-smelling
corridor, out of which the studio opens.
Here they wait perforce, until at last the
studio door opens, and some people of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>farming class, and very flurried and flushed,
walk nervously down the little lane between
them.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now is your time!’ says Betty, who is
really quite irrepressible to-day. She takes
the lead, and they all swarm after her into
the studio, to find there an emaciated man in
highly respectable clothes regarding them
with a melancholy eye. Collodion seems to
have saturated him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Aunt Jemima, you first,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, certainly,’ says Dom. ‘First come,
first served. And, you know, in spite of
Betty’s well-meant endeavours, you entered
the room first.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Besides which it is the part of the young
to give way to their elders,’ says Miss Barry,
striving to keep up her dignity, whilst dying
with terror. The photographer and the great
big thing over there with dingy velvet cloth
over it have subdued her almost out of recognition.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, auntie, come on. He’s looking at
you.’ ‘He’ is the photographer, who has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>now, indeed, turned a lack-lustre eye on
Miss Barry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We are rather pressed for time,’ says he
in a lugubrious tone. ‘Which lady wishes
to be taken first?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Answer him, auntie,’ says Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What impertinence, hurrying us like
this!’ says Miss Barry. She has recovered
something of her old courage now, though
still frightened, and turns a freezing eye
upon the photographer, who is so accustomed
to all sorts of eyes that it fails to
affect him in any way.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Really, auntie, you ought to have yours
taken first,’ says Dominick seriously, ‘and
as soon as possible. There’s murder in that
man’s eye. Don’t incense him further.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The photographer is now standing in an
adamantine attitude, but his eye, entreating,
cries: ‘Come on, come on!’</p>

<p class='c004'>But no one stirs.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A most insolent creature,’ says Miss
Barry, who has unfortunately taken a dislike
to him. ‘Look at him; one would think we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>had to have our pictures taken by law rather
than by choice. Susan, did you ever see so
villainous a countenance? No, my dear, I—I
really feel—I couldn’t have my picture sent
to your uncle if taken by an assassin like
that.’ She holds back.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense, Miss Barry!’ says Crosby gaily.
‘You have too much spirit to be daunted by
a mere cast of countenance. And we—we
have no spirit at all—so we depend upon
you to give us a lead.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I assure you, Mr. Crosby, had it been any
other man but this.... However, I submit.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Whereupon, with much outward dignity
and many inward quakings, she approaches
the chair before the camera and seats herself
upon it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A little more this way, please, ma’am,’
says the photographer.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Which way?’ asks Miss Barry, in a distinctly
aggressive voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you would pose yourself a little more
like this,’ and the photographer throws himself
into a sentimental attitude.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>‘Mercy! what ails the man?’ says Miss
Barry, turning to Crosby. ‘Do you, my dear
Mr. Crosby—do you think the wretched being
has been imbibing too freely?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, no, not at all,’ says Crosby reassuringly.
‘You must sit like this’—coming
to the photographer’s help with a will—‘just
a little bit round here, d’ye see, so as to make
a good picture. That will give a better effect
afterwards; and of course he is anxious to
make as good a photograph of you as he can.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this Miss Barry condescends to move a
little in the way directed. She clutches hold
of Susan, however, during the placing of her,
and whispers thrillingly:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t believe in him, Susan. Look at
his eye. It squints! Could a squinter give
one a good photograph?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, madam!’ says the camera man, in
a dying tone. He has heard nothing, but is
annoyed in a dejected fashion by the delay.
‘If you are quite ready.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Are you?’ retorts Miss Barry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, ma’am.’ He comes forward to rearrange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>her draperies and herself, her short
colloquy with Susan having been sufficiently
lively to disturb the recent pose. He pulls
out her gown, then steps back to further
study her, and finally takes her head between
his hands, with a view to putting that into
the right position also.</p>

<p class='c004'>If the poor man had only known the consequences
of this rash act, he would, perhaps,
rather have given up his profession than have
committed it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How dare you, sir!’ cries Miss Barry,
pushing him back, and making frightful
passes in the air as a defence against another
attack of his upon her maiden cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Carew, where are you? Dominick!
Susan, Susan, do you see how I have been
outraged?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dear auntie,’ says Susan, in a low tone,
Carew and Dominick being incapacitated for
service, ‘you mistake him. He only wants
to arrange you for your picture. It is always
done. Don’t you see?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t,’ says Miss Barry stoutly. ‘I see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>only that you are all a silly set of children,
who do not understand the iniquity of man!
This creature—’ She points to the photographer,
who has gone back in a melancholy
way to his slides, and is pulling them in and
out, by way of exercise, perhaps. ‘However,
Susan, I’ll go through with it, insolent
and depraved as this creature evidently is;
coming from a huge metropolis like Dublin,
he scarcely knows how to behave himself with
decent people. I must request you to tell
him, however, that I refuse—absolutely
refuse—to let him caress my face again!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Thus peace is restored with honour, for
the time being. And the unlucky man who
has been selected by an unkind Providence
to transmit Miss Barry’s face to futurity,
once again approaches her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, ma’am, if you will kindly sit just
so, and if you will look at this—a little more
pleasantly, please’—holding up a photograph
of Lord Rosebery that he has been carrying
about to delight the Irish people. ‘Ah, that’s
better; that earnest expression will—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>‘Who’s that?’ cries Miss Barry, springing
to her feet. ‘Is that the Radical miscreant
who has taken old Gladstone’s place? God
bless me, man! do you think I’m going to be
pleasant when I look at him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>The wretched photographer, now utterly
dumfounded, casts a despairing glance at
Crosby, who is certainly the oldest, and
therefore probably the most sensible, of the
rest. The noise of the feet of impatient
customers in the passage outside is rendering
the poor man miserable. Yet it is impossible
to turn this terrible old woman out,
when there are so many with her waiting to
be taken, and to pay their money.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I assure you, sir, I thought that picture
would please the lady. I’m only lately from
England, and they told me—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A lot of lies. Ah yes, that’s of course,’
says Crosby, interrupting him sympathetically.
‘But what they didn’t teach you was
that there are two opinions, you know. You
can show Lord Rosebery to the people who
have not a shilling in the world, and not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>grandfather amongst them; but I think you
had better show Miss Barry a photograph of
Lord Salisbury, and if you haven’t that, one
of the Queen. She’s quite devoted to the
Queen.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish I’d been told, sir,’ says the photographer,
so wearily that Crosby decides on
giving him a substantial tip for himself when
the sittings are over.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Now, ma’am,’ says the photographer, returning
to the charge with splendid courage,
seeing Miss Barry has reseated herself in the
chair, after prolonged persuasion from Carew
and Susan. Betty and Dominick, it must
be confessed, have behaved disgracefully.
Retiring behind a huge screen, and there
stifling their mirth in an extremely insufficient
manner, gurgles and, indeed, gasps,
have come from between its joints to the
terrified Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And now, ma’am, will you kindly turn a
little more this way?’ The poor man’s voice
has grown quite apologetic. ‘Ah, that’s
better! Thank you, ma’am. And if I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>might pull out your dress? Yes, that’s all
right. And your elbow, ma’am, please.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Good gracious! why can’t he stop,’ thinks
poor Susan, who sees wrath growing again
within Miss Barry’s eye.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is just a little, a very little, too pointed.
Ah, yes. There! And your foot, ma’am—under
your dress, if you please.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Miss Barry snorts audibly, and the
photographer starts back; but hearing is not
seeing, and he rashly regains his courage and
rushes to his destruction.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That’s well, very well,’ says he, not being
sufficiently acquainted with Miss Barry to
note the signs of coming war upon her
face; ‘and if you will now please shut your
mouth—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry rises once more like a whirlwind.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Shut your own, sir!’ cries she, shaking
her fist at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is one awful moment, a moment
charged with electricity; then it is all over.
The worst has come, there can be nothing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>more. Miss Barry is again pressed into her
chair. The photographer, having come to the
comforting conclusion that she is a confirmed
lunatic, takes no more pains over her, refuses
to adjust her robe, to put her face into
position or revise her expression, and simply
takes her as she is. The result is that he
turns out the very best photograph he has
taken for many a year.</p>

<p class='c004'>After this things go smooth enough, until
at last even Betty—who has proved a troublesome
customer, if a very charming one—declares
herself satisfied.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No more, sir?’ says the photographer to
Crosby, whom he has elected to address as
being the principal member of the party.
To speak to Miss Barry would have been
beyond the poor man.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh yes, one more,’ says Crosby.</p>

<p class='c010'>He draws Bonnie forward—Bonnie, who has
been sitting so quietly in his corner for the
past thirty minutes, enchanted with the
strange scene. He has cared nothing for
his aunt’s eccentricities; he has thought
only of the wonderful things that were done
behind that dingy black velvet curtain. Oh,
if he could only get behind it too, and find
out! The sickly child’s frame was weak, but
his mind was fresh and strong, and ran freely
into regions far beyond his ken.</p>

<p class='c004'>With the boy’s hand in his, Crosby turns
courteously to Miss Barry.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you will let me have this charming
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>face taken, if only for my own gratification,’
says he. ‘I have long wished it. And as he
is here—if you will allow me. It is quite
an ideal type, you know—I may have him
photographed?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—yes,’ says Miss Barry, with slow
acquiescence, uttered with a pause between.
And then all at once, as if she has come to
the end of her hesitation, ‘Yes, certainly.’
She looks at Susan as if for approval, but
Susan does not return her glance. She has
cast down her eyes, and is distinctly pale.</p>

<p class='c004'>Poor Susan! So delighted at the thought
of having a picture of her Bonnie given her,
yet so sorry for the occasion of it. She has
lowered her eyes so that no one may see
what she is thinking about, or what she is
suffering; the quick beating of her heart is
also a secret known only to herself.</p>

<p class='c004'>The throbs run like this: Oh, how good of
him! Oh, no matter what he is or whom he
loves, he will surely give her one of Bonnie’s
pictures—a picture of her lovely, pretty
Bonnie!</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>Meantime, Bonnie is being taken by the
photographer, and so still, so calm a little
subject he is, that his picture is, perhaps, the
best of all, after Miss Barry’s, which is
unique. Just Bonnie’s head—only that. But
so sweet, so perfect, and the earnest eyes—</p>

<p class='c004'>The photographer tells them that they
shall have them all in a week or so. The
photographer’s ‘week or so’ is so well understanded
of the people, that the Barrys tell
themselves in whispers in the little studio
that if they get them in a fortnight they may
thank their lucky stars.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘A fortnight with that man!’ says Miss
Barry, with ill-subdued wrath. ‘A month,
you mean. I tell you he’s got the evil eye.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Having thus relieved herself, and the
photographer having vanished into a room
beyond, she rises into happier ways.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Any way, in spite of him,’ says she,
pointing towards the dark doorway into
which he has vanished, ‘this must be called
a most happy occasion—an auspicious one
even, indeed.’ Miss Barry is always on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>immense terms with her dictionary. ‘I really
think’—with sudden sprightliness—‘we
should all exchange photos. I hope, Mr.
Crosby’—turning pleasantly to him—‘that
you will give us one of yours.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall give you one with pleasure, Miss
Barry,’ says Crosby, ‘and feel very proud
about your wanting to have it. I shall,
however, demand one of yours in return.
As to your suggestion about a general
exchange, I think it delightful.’ He turns
suddenly to Susan. ‘I hope you will give
me one of yours,’ says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan hesitates. To give her picture to
him, when he thinks Lady Muriel Kennedy
so lovely? Why, if he thinks a girl is so
very lovely—she has described Lady Muriel
to herself as a mere girl—why should he
want a photograph of herself?</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry has noticed Susan’s hanging
back, and, wondering that she should refuse
her photograph to so good a friend, comes
quickly forward.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, I really think you might give
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>Mr. Crosby your picture. You know, Mr.
Crosby, I have always kept the girls a little
strict, and perhaps Susan thinks—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t,’ says Susan, with sudden vehemence.
She has shrunk back a little; her
lovely eyes have suddenly grown shamed.
‘It—isn’t that, auntie.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, my dear, if it isn’t that—’ says
Miss Barry; and being now called by
Dominick, she turns away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Auntie takes such queer views of things,’
says Susan, pale and unhappy. ‘It seems,
however, that she would like me to give you
my photograph. Well’—grudgingly—‘you
can have it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I didn’t want it on those terms,’ says
Crosby. ‘And yet’—quickly—‘I do on any
terms.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no,’ says Susan; ‘auntie is right.
Why should I refuse it to you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says he, ‘is the feud so strong as
all that? Will you refuse me your picture?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, I shall give it,’ says she, faintly
smiling; ‘but I shall make a bargain with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>you. If you will give me one of Bonnie’s,
you shall have one of mine.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I gain, but you do not,’ says he; ‘for you
should have had one of Bonnie all the same.
But what has come between us, Susan? I
thought I was quite a friend of yours. Why
am I to be dismissed like this, without even a
character? You must remember one great
occasion when you said that anyone who was
allowed to go through my grounds would be
sure to treat me with respect, or something
like that. Now, you have often gone through
my grounds, Susan, and is this respect that
you are offering me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought,’ says Susan gravely, ‘that you
promised never to speak of that again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Of what—respect?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, of that’—reluctantly—‘that day in
the garden.’ The dawn of a blush appears
upon her face, and her eyes rest on him reproachfully.
‘You are not to be depended
on,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Susan!’</p>

<p class='c004'>His air is so abject that, in spite of herself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>Susan laughs, and presently she holds out her
hand to him with the sweetest air. ‘Any
way, I have to thank you a thousand times
for having had my Bonnie’s picture taken,’
says she. ‘And I know you knew that I
wished for it.’ She gives him her hand.
Tears rise to her eyes. ‘You could never
know how I wished for it,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c010'>‘Now, Miss Manning,’ says Wyndham, in his
quick, alert, business-like way. He steps
back, and motions her to go through the
gateway that Mrs. Denis had opened about
three inches a minute ago.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Manning, a tall, thin, rather nervous-looking
lady of very decided age, steps
inside the gate, and glances from Wyndham
to Mrs. Denis and back again interrogatively.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘This is Miss Moore’s housekeeper, cook,
and general factotum,’ says Wyndham, making
a hasty introduction, and with a warning
glance towards Mrs. Denis, who has dropped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>a rather stiff curtsy. ‘Yours too. She
will remove all troubles from your shoulders,
and will take excellent care of you, I don’t
doubt.’ He pauses to give Mrs. Denis—who
is looking glum, to say the least of it—room
for one of her always only too ready speeches,
but nothing comes. ‘Eh?’ says he, in a
sharp metallic voice that brings Mrs. Denis
to her senses with a jump.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, sir,’ says she, and no more—no promises
of obedience.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham hurries Miss Manning past her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The other maid you can manage,’ says he,
in a low tone, ‘and no doubt Mrs. Denis after
awhile. She is a highly respectable woman,
if a little unreasonable, and a little too devoted
to your pupil. About the latter’—hastily—‘you
know everything—her whole
history—that is, so far as I know it—even to
her peculiarities. You quite understand that
she refuses to leave these grounds, and you
know, too, her reasons for refusing—reasons
not to be combated. They seem absurd to
me, as I don’t believe that fellow has the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>slightest claim upon her; but she thinks
otherwise. And—well, they are her reasons’—he
pauses—‘and therefore to be respected.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly,’ says Miss Manning, in a low,
very gentle voice, ‘and I shall respect them.’
Her voice is charming. Wyndham tells himself
that he could hardly have made a better
choice of a companion for this strange girl
who has been so inconveniently flung into
his life. Miss Manning’s face, too, is one to
inspire instant confidence. Her eyes are
earnest and thoughtful; her mouth kind, if
sad. That she has endured much sorrow is
written on every feature; but troubles have
failed to embitter a spirit made up of Nature’s
sweetest graces. And now, indeed, joy is
lighting up her gentle eyes, and happy
expectancy is making warm her heart. A
month ago she had been in almost abject
poverty—scarce knowing where to find the
next day’s bread—when a most merciful God
had sent her Paul Wyndham to lift her from
her Slough of Despond to such a state
of prosperity as she had never dared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>dream of since as a child she ran gaily in her
father’s meadows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am sure of that,’ says Wyndham heartily.
‘I am certain I can give her into your hands
in all safety. I know very little of her, but
she seems a good girl, not altogether tractable,
perhaps, but I hope you will be able to
get on with her. If, however, the dulness,
the enforced solitude, becomes too much for
you, you must let me know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall never have to let you know that,’
says Miss Manning, in a low, tremulous tone.
‘A home in the country, a young companion,
a garden to tend—for long and very sad
years I have dreamt of such things, but
never with a hope of seeing them. And
now, if I have seemed poor in my thanks,
Paul—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She breaks off, turning her head aside.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes; I understand,’ says Wyndham
hurriedly, dreading, yet feeling very tenderly
towards her emotion. Once again he congratulates
himself on having thought of this
sweet woman in his difficulty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>‘And for myself,’ says she, calmly now
again, ‘I should never like to stir from this
lovely garden.’ They are walking by one of
the paths bordered with flowers. ‘I have
been so long accustomed to solitude that,
like my pupil, I shrink from breaking it. To
see no one but her and’—delicately—‘you
occasionally, I hope, is all I ask.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You may perhaps have to see the Barrys
now and then—the Rector’s people. They
live over the way,’ says Wyndham, pointing
towards where the Rectory trees can be seen.
‘I found the last time I was here that Susan,
the eldest girl, had come in, or been brought
in here by Miss Moore, so that there is
already a slight acquaintance; and with girls,’
says the barrister, somewhat contemptuously,
‘that means an immediate, if not altogether
undying, friendship.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Miss Manning. She feels a
faint surprise. ‘It is not so much, then, that
she does not desire to know people, as that
she refuses to stir out of this place?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is how I take it. I wanted her very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>much to move about, to let herself be known.
Honestly’—colouring slightly—‘it is rather
awkward for me to have a tenant so very
mysterious as she seems bent on being. I
urged her to declare herself at once as my
tenant and wait events; but she seemed so
terrified at the idea of leaving these four
walls that I gave up the argument. Perhaps
you may bring her to reason, or perhaps
the Rector and his youngsters may
have the desired effect of putting an end to
this morbidity. By-the-by, I am going over
to the Rectory after I have introduced you
to—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ella’ was on the tip of his tongue, but he
substitutes ‘Miss Moore’ in time.</p>

<p class='c004'>The very near slip renders him thoughtful
for a moment or two. Why should he have
called her Ella? Had he ever thought of
her as Ella? Most positively never.</p>

<p class='c004'>He is so absorbed in his introspection that
he fails to see a slight, timid figure coming
down the steps of the Cottage. Miss Manning
touches his arm.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>‘Is this Miss Moore?’ cries she, in an
excited whisper. ‘Oh, what a charming
face!’</p>

<p class='c004'>And, indeed, Ella is charming as she now
advances—very pale, as if frightened, and
with her dark eyes glancing anxiously from
Wyndham to the stranger and back again.
She has no hat on her head, and a sunbeam
has caught her chestnut hair and turned it to
glistening gold.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I hope you received my letter last night,’
says Wyndham, calling out to her and
hastening his footsteps. ‘You see’—awkwardly—‘I
have brought—brought you—’
He stops, waiting for Miss Manning to come
up, and growing hopelessly embarrassed.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your friend, my dear, I trust,’ says Miss
Manning gently, taking the girl’s hand in
both her own and regarding her with anxious
eyes.</p>

<p class='c004'>Ella flushes crimson. She has so dreaded,
so feared, this moment, and now this gentle,
sad-eyed woman, with her soft voice and
pretty impulsive speech! Tears rise to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>girl’s eyes. Nervously, yet eagerly, she
leans forward and presses her lips to Miss
Manning’s fair, if withered, cheek.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, congratulating himself on the
success of his latest enterprise, takes himself
off presently to inspect a farm five miles
farther out in the country, that had been left
to him by his mother, with the Cottage. He
has determined on taking the Rectory on his
way back to meet the evening train—to
enlist further Mr. Barry’s sympathy for his
tenant. He tells himself, with a glow of self-satisfaction,
that he is uncommonly good to
his tenant; but so, of course, he ought to be,
that dying promise to the Professor being
sacred; and if it were not for the affection he
had always felt for that great dead man, he
would beyond doubt never have thought of
her again.... There is much moral support
in this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes, he will spend half an hour at the
Rectory. He can get back from the farm in
plenty of time for that, and Miss Manning
being an old friend of the Rector’s, the latter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>will be even more inclined to take up her
pupil, which will be a good thing for the
poor girl. He repeats the words ‘poor girl,’
and finds satisfaction in them. They seem
to show how entirely indifferent he is to her
and her fortunes. That mental slip of his
awhile ago had alarmed him slightly. But
‘poor girl,’ to call her that precludes the
idea of anything like—pshaw!</p>

<p class='c004'>He dismisses the ‘poor girl’ from his mind
forthwith, and succeeds admirably in getting
rid of her, whilst blowing up his other tenants
on the farm. But on his way back again to
Curraghcloyne her memory once more becomes
troublesome.</p>

<p class='c004'>To-day, so far, things have gone well.
She has seemed satisfied with Miss Manning,
and Miss Manning with her. And as for the
fear of an immediate scandal, that seems
quite at rest. But in time the old worry is
sure to mount to the surface again. For
example, when Mrs. Prior hears of her—he
wishes now, trudging grimly over the uneven
road, that he had not led that astute woman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>to believe his tenant was a man—as she inevitably
must, there will be a row on somewhere
that will make the welkin ring; and
after that, good-bye to his chances with Lord
Shangarry, who has very special views about
the right and the wrong.</p>

<p class='c004'>If only this silly girl could be persuaded to
come out of her shell and mingle with her
kind, all might be got over after a faint
wrestle or two. But no! Angrily he tells
himself that there is no chance of that. Soft
as she looks, and gentle, and lov—h’m—he
kicks a stone out of his way—and pleasant-looking,
and all that, he feels absolutely sure
that nobody will be able to drag her out of
her self-imposed imprisonment.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>After this diatribe, it is only natural that
he should, on entering the Rectory garden,
feel himself a prey to astonishment on seeing,
amongst a turbulent group upon the edges of
the tennis-court, the ‘poor girl’ laughing with
all her heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>He stands still, within the shelter of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>laurels, to ask himself if his eyesight has
failed him thus early in life. But his eyesight
still continues excellent, and when he
sees the ‘poor girl’ pick up Tommy and
plant him on her knee, he knows that all
is well with his visual organs.</p>

<p class='c004'>The fact is that, almost as he left the
Cottage by the front-gate, Susan had run
across the road and hammered loudly at the
little green one. This primitive knocking
had become a signal now with the Barrys
and Ella, and soon the latter had rushed to
open the door. There had been entreaties
from Susan that she would come over now—now,
at once—and have a game of tennis with
them. She did not know tennis. All the
more reason why she should begin to learn;
and Aunt Jemima was quite pining to know
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, do come!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No—no, I can’t. I have said I would
never leave this place.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that, of course; but—oh!—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Susan breaks off abruptly. Who is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>that pretty, tall lady coming down the path?
It is Miss Manning, and Ella very shyly
introduces Susan to her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Miss Manning, tell her to come and play
tennis with us this afternoon,’ says Susan.
‘Not a soul but ourselves, and she’s very
lonely here. Father says she ought to see
people.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think as your father does,’ says Miss
Manning gently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And will you come too?’ asks Susan.
‘Aunt Jemima’—with born courtesy—‘will
come and see you to-morrow, but in the
meantime—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am afraid I have some unpacking to do,’
says Miss Manning, smiling, having fallen in
love with Susan’s soft, flushed face and
childish air. ‘But if you can persuade Ella—I
know, my dear’—to Ella, who has
turned a sad face to hers, a face that has
yet the longing for larger life upon it—‘that
you wish never to leave this place. But to
go just across the road.... And there is no
one there, Miss Barry tells you; and it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>only a step or two, and’—smiling again—‘if
you wish it, I’ll go over in an hour and bring
you back again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No, don’t do that,’ says Ella. ‘You are
tired.’ She hesitates, then looks out of the
gateway, and up and down the lane. It is
quite empty. ‘Well, I’ll come,’ says she,
giving her hand to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is evidently a desperate resolve. Even
as she says it, she makes a last drawback, but
Susan clings to her hand, and pulls her
forward, and together the girls run down the
lane to the Rectory gate and into it, Ella all
the time holding Susan tightly, as if for protection.</p>

<p class='c004'>This was how it happened that Ella first
left the shelter of the Cottage. She was
most kindly received by the Rector, who
spared a moment from his precious books to
welcome her—and even agreeably by Aunt
Jemima. Ella had gone through the ordeal
of these two introductions shyly but quietly.
She had, however, been a little startled at
finding that, added to the Barrys congregated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>on the lawn (a goodly number in themselves),
there was a strange gentleman. Crosby
struck her at first sight as being formidable—an
idea that, if the young Barrys had
known it, would have sent them into hysterics
of mirth.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby had strolled down early in the
afternoon, and now Wyndham, standing
gazing amongst the shrubberies, can see him
turn from Susan to say something or other
to Ella.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham, in his voluntary confinement,
feels a sharp pang clutch at his breast. He
stands still, as if unable to go on, watching
the little pantomime.</p>

<p class='c004'>Tommy is speaking now. The child’s voice
rings clear and low.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’ll tell you a story.’ He has put up a
little fat hand, and is pinching Ella’s cheek.
Ella has caught the little hand, and is kissing
it. How pretty!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Silence!’ cries Crosby gaily. ‘Tommy is
going to tell Miss Moore a story.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There seems something significant to Wyndham
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>in his tone. Why should he demand
silence in that imperative manner, just
because Miss Moore wishes a story to be told
to her? He hesitates no longer. He comes
quickly forward and up to the group.</p>

      <div class='line in2'>And find all her promises vain.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Susan sees him first, and, pushing Bonnie
gently from her, rises to meet him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How do you do?’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That you, Wyndham?’ cries Crosby.
‘You are just in time to hear Tommy’s story.
Miss Moore has promised to lend him her
support during the recital.’</p>

<p class='c004'>For all Crosby’s lightness of tone, there is
a strange, scrutinizing expression in his clever
eyes as he looks at Wyndham. He knows
that Ella Moore’s presence here must prove a
surprise to him; and how will he take it?
The girl seems well enough, but—And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>if Wyndham has been capable of placing so
close to this family of young, young people
someone who—</p>

<p class='c004'>He is studying Wyndham very acutely.
But all that he can make out of Wyndham’s
face is surprise, and something that might be
termed relief—nothing more. As for the
girl, she is the one that looks confused. She
rises, holding Tommy by her side, and looks
appealingly at Wyndham. She would have
spoken, perhaps, but that the Rector, who
has not yet gone back to his study, takes up
the parable.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We are very glad to have persuaded Miss
Moore to come here to-day,’ says he, in a
tone to be heard by everyone. ‘She has told
me that you came down this morning, bringing
Miss Manning with you. That will be a
source of pleasure to us all, I am quite sure.’</p>

<p class='c004'>He bows his courteous old head as amiably
as though Miss Manning over the road could
hear him. It is a tribute to her perfections.
After this he buttonholes Wyndham, and
draws him apart a bit.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>‘She’s a nice girl, Wyndham—a nice girl,
I really think. A most guileless countenance!
But not educated, you know. Betty and
Susan—mere children as they are—could
almost teach her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Rector sighs. He always regards his
girls as having stood still since his wife’s
death. Children they were then, children
they are now. He has not seemed to live
himself since her death. Since that, indeed,
all things have stood still for him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. But she seems intelligent—clever,’
says Wyndham, a little coldly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I dare say. And now you have secured
Miss Manning for her! That is a wise step,’
says the Rector thoughtfully. ‘She owes you
much, Wyndham. I was glad when Susan
persuaded her to come over here to-day.
But I doubt if she will consent to go further.
She seems terrified at the thought of being
far from your—her home. Have you not
yet discovered any trace of that scoundrel
Moore? The bond between them might
surely be broken.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>‘There is no bond between them. Of that
I am convinced,’ says Wyndham.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I trust not—I trust not,’ says the Rector.
He makes a little gesture of farewell, and goes
back to his beloved study, his head bent, his
hands clasped behind his back, as usual.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We’re waiting for you, Mr. Wyndham,’
calls out Betty, arching her slender neck to
look over Dominick’s shoulder. The wind
has caught her fair, fluffy hair, and is ruffling
it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; come along, Wyndham,’ says Crosby.
‘Tommy’s story is yet to tell.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Better have one from you instead, Mr.
Crosby,’ says Susan hastily. She knows
Tommy. ‘You can tell us all about lions and
niggers and things. You’d like to hear of
lions and niggers, Tommy’—in a wheedling
tone—‘wouldn’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham by this time has joined the
group, and, scarcely knowing how, finds
himself sitting on half of a rug, the other
half of which belongs to his tenant.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I want to tell my own story,’ says Tommy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>with determination. He is evidently a boy
possessed of much firmness, and one not to
be ‘done’ by anyone if he can help it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, Tommy,’ persists Susan, who has
dismal reasons for dreading his literary
efforts, ‘I think you had better not tell one
just now. We—that is—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, do let him tell it!’ says Ella
softly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear Susan,’ says Crosby, ‘would you
deprive us of an entertainment so unique—one
we may never enjoy again?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, go on, Tommy,’ says Susan, resigning
herself to the worst.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘There once was a man,’ begins Tommy;
and pauses. Silence reigns around. ‘An’
he fell into a big bit of water.’ The silence
grows profounder. ‘’Twas as big as this’—making
a movement of his short arms a foot
or so from the ground. At this there are
distinct groans of fear. ‘An’ he was
drownded—a little fish ate him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, Tommy!’ says Susan, in woeful tones.
She can now pretend to be frightened with a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>free heart. Evidently Tommy’s story this
time is going to be of the mildest order.
‘He didn’t really eat him?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘He did—he did!’ says Tommy, delighted
at Susan’s fright. ‘He ate him all up—every
bit of him!’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Susan lets her face fall into her hands,
and Tommy relents.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But he wasn’t killed,’ says he. He looks
anxiously at Susan’s bowed head. ‘No, he
wasn’t.’ Susan lifts her head, and shakes it
at him reproachfully. ‘Well, he wasn’t,
really,’ says Tommy again. This repetition
is not only meant as a help to Susan to
mitigate her extreme grief, but to give
him pause whilst he makes up another
chapter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, are you sure?’ asks Susan tragically.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I am. The fish swallowed him, but he
came up again.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who gave the emetic?’ asks Dominick;
but very properly no one attends to
him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; well, what’s after that?’ asks Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>‘Well—’ Tommy stares at the earth,
and then, with happy inspiration, adds:
‘The nasty witch got him.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Poor old soul!’ says Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The witch, Tommy? But—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, the witch’—angrily. ‘An’ then the
goat said—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Goat! What goat?’ asks Ella very
naturally, considering all things.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That goat,’ says Tommy, who really is
wonderful. He points his lovely fat thumb
down to where, in the distant field, a goat is
browsing. His wandering eye had caught it
as he vaguely talked, and he had at once
embezzled it and twisted it into his imagination.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes?’ says Susan, seeing the child pause,
and trying to help him. ‘The goat?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The goat an’ the witch—’ Long pause
here, and plain incapacity to proceed. Tommy
has evidently come face to face with a
<i><span lang="fr">cul de sac</span></i>.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Hole in the ballad,’ says Dominick to
Betty in a low tone.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>‘Go on, Tommy,’ says Susan encouragingly.
Really, Tommy’s story is so presentable this
time that she quite likes to give him a lift, as
it were.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, the witch fell down,’ says Tommy,
goaded to endeavour, ‘an’ the goat sat on
her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not on her,’ says Susan, with dainty
protest. ‘You know you frightened me once,
Tommy, but now—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, they did, Susan—they did.’ In his
excitement he has duplicated the enemy.
‘They all sat down on her—every one of
them, twenty of them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But, Tommy, you said there was only one
goat.’</p>

<p class='c004'>This is rash of Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t care,’ cries Tommy, who is of a
liberal disposition. ‘There was twenty of
them. An’ they all sat down on her, first on
her stomach, an’’—solemnly turning himself
and clasping both his fat hands over the seat
of his small breeches—‘an’ then on her here.’
He lifts his hands and smacks them down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>again. He indeed most graphically illustrates
his ‘here.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There is an awful silence. Susan, stricken
dumb, sits silent. She knew how it would
be if she let that wretched child speak.</p>

<p class='c004'>Shamed and horrified, she draws back,
almost praying that the earth may open
and swallow her up quick. She casts a
despairing glance at Crosby, to see how he
has taken this horrible fiasco, before following
Dathan and Abiram; but what she sees in
his face stops her prayers, and, in fact,
reverses them.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby is shaking with laughter, and now,
as she looks, catches Tommy in his arms and
hugs him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Another moment and Betty breaks into a
wild burst of laughter, after which everyone
else follows suit.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m going to publish your story, Tommy,
at any price,’ says Mr. Crosby, putting
Tommy back from him upon his knee, and
gazing with interest at that tiny astonished
child. ‘There will be trouble with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>publishers. But I’ll get it done at all risks
to life and limb. I don’t suppose I shall be
spoken to afterwards by any respectable
person, but that is of little moment when a
literary gem is in question.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Tommy, not understanding, but scenting
fun, laughs gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think you ought to encourage
him like that,’ says Susan, whose pretty
mouth, however, is sweet with smiles.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘One should always encourage a genius,’
says Crosby, undismayed.</p>

<p class='c004'>There is a little stir here. Tommy has
wriggled out of Crosby’s lap and has gone
back to Ella, who receives him with—literally—open
arms.</p>

<p class='c004'>Wyndham is watching her curiously. Her
manner all through Tommy’s absorbingly
interesting tale has been a revelation to him.
He has found out for one thing that he has
never heard her laugh before—at all events,
not like that. No, he has never heard her
really laugh before, and, indeed, perhaps poor
Ella, in all her sad young life, has never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>laughed like that until now. It has been to
the shrewd young barrister as though he has
looked upon her for the first time to-day after
quite two months of acquaintance—he who
prides himself, and has often been complimented,
on his knowledge of character, his
grasp of a client’s real mind from his first
half-hour with him or her.</p>

<p class='c004'>Her mirth has astonished him. She, the
pale, frightened girl, to laugh like that!
There has been no loudness in her mirth,
either; it has been soft and refined, if very
gay and happy. She has laughed as a girl
might who has been born to happiness in
every way—to silken robes and delicate surroundings,
and all the paraphernalia that go
to make up the life of those born into families
that can count their many grandfathers.</p>

<p class='c004'>Once or twice he has told himself half impatiently—angry
with the charge laid upon
his unwitting shoulders—that the girl is
good-looking. Now he tells himself something
more: that she is lovely, with that
smile upon her face, as she sits—all unconscious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>of his criticism—with Tommy in her
arms, and</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in24'>‘Eyes</div>
      <div class='line'>Upglancing brightly mischievous, a spring</div>
      <div class='line'>Of brimming laughter welling on the brink</div>
      <div class='line'>Of lips like flowers, small caressing hands</div>
      <div class='line'>Tight locked,’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'>around the lucky Tommy’s waist.</p>

<p class='c004'>But now she puts Tommy (who has
evidently fallen a slave to her charms, and
repudiates loudly her right to give him
away like this) down on his sturdy feet,
and comes a little forward to where Susan
is standing.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m afraid I must go now,’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, not yet,’ says Susan; ‘there is plenty
of time. It isn’t as if you had to drive five
miles to get to your home.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still—I think—’ She looks so anxious
that Susan, who is always charming, understands
her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you must go,’ whispers she sweetly—‘if
you would rather—well, then, do go.
But to-morrow, and every other day, you
must come back to us. Carew—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>‘I’m here,’ says Carew, coming up, and
blushing as well as the best of girls as he
takes Ella’s hand. ‘I’ll see you home,’
says he.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think it will be necessary,’ says
Wyndham shortly. Then he stops, confounded
at his own imprudence, considering
all the circumstances. Yet the words have
fallen from him without volition of his own.
‘The fact is,’ says he quickly, ‘I too am
going now, and will be able to see Miss
Moore safely within her gate.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Carew frowns, and Susan comes to the
rescue.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘We’ll all go,’ cries she gaily.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The very thing,’ says Crosby. ‘That
will give me a little more of your society, as
I also must drag myself away.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The ‘your’ is so very general that nobody
takes any notice of it, and they all go up the
small avenue together.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You were surprised to see me here?’ says
Ella in a nervous whisper to Wyndham, who
has doggedly taken possession of her, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>spite of the knowledge that such a proceeding
will in the end tell against him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I confess I was’—stiffly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You are displeased?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On the contrary, you know I always
advised you to show yourself—to defy
your enemies. You can defy them, you
know.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes; but—I mean that, after all I said to
you about my dislike, my fear, of leaving the
Cottage, you must think it queer of me to be
here to-day.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I do not, indeed. I think it only natural
that you should break through such a melancholy
determination. Besides, no doubt’—with
increasing coldness—‘you had an inducement.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, yes; I had,’ says she quickly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Ah!’ A pause. ‘Someone you have
seen lately?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Quite lately.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Second pause, and prolonged.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I suppose you will soon see a way out of
all your difficulties?’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>No doubt she had fallen in love with
Crosby, and he with her, and—</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No; I don’t think there is any chance of
that,’ says she mournfully. ‘But when Su—Miss
Barry asked me to come here, I couldn’t
resist it. You can see for yourself what an
inducement she is.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan! is it only Susan? He pulls himself
up sharply. Well, and if so, where is
the matter for rejoicing? Of course, being
left in a sense her guardian by the Professor,
he is bound to feel an interest in her; but a
vague interest such as that should not be
accompanied by this quick relief, this sudden
sensation of—of what?</p>

<p class='c004'>Dominick, just behind him, is singing at
the top of his lungs—sound ones:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘As I walked out wid Dinah,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>De other afternoon,</div>
      <div class='line'>De day could not be finer,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Ho! de ring-tailed coon!’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c004'>He is evidently pointing this nigger melody
at Betty, who has been rash enough to go
walking out with him. She has gone even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>farther. She has condescended to sing a
second to his exceedingly loud first, a stroke
of genius on her part, as it has taken the
wind out of his sails so far as his belief in
his powers of teasing her (on this occasion,
at all events) are concerned.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Wyndham takes the opportunity of
the second verse coming to a thrilling conclusion
to break off his conversation with
Ella. And now, indeed, they are all at the
little green gate, and are saying their adieus
to her. And presently they have all gone
away again, and Ella, standing inside, feels
as if life and joy and all things have been
shut off from her with the locking of that
small green gate.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>‘Isn’t she pretty?’ cries Susan enthusiastically,
when they have bidden good-bye
to Crosby and Wyndham too, and are back
again on their own small lawn.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘She’s a regular bud,’ says Dom, striking
a tragic attitude. He doesn’t mean anything
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>really, but Carew, with darkling brow, goes
up to him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I think you ought to speak more respectfully
of her,’ says he. ‘It isn’t because she
is alone in the world that one should throw
stones at her.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Betty, I appeal to you,’ says Dominick.
‘Did I throw a stone? Come, speak up. I
take this as a distinct insult. The man who
would throw a stone at a woman—He’s
gone!’ says Mr. Fitzgerald, staring at Carew’s
disappearing form. ‘Well, I do call that
mean. And I had arranged a peroration
that would have astonished the natives.
Anyway, Susan’—turning—‘what did I say
to offend him? Called her a bud. Isn’t a
bud a nice thing? I declare he’s as touchy
about her as though she were his best
girl.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’s a best girl?’ asks Betty.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The one you like best.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, perhaps she’s his’—growing interested.
‘Susan, I do believe he is in love
with her.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>‘Do you?’ says Susan thoughtfully. And
then: ‘Oh no! Boys never fall in love.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Dom thinks they do,’ says Betty, turning
a saucy glance on Fitzgerald. She flings a
rose at him. ‘Who’s your best girl?’ asks she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Need you ask?’ returns that youth with
his most sentimental air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t think I quite approve of her,’
says Miss Barry, joining in the conversation
at this moment, and shaking her curls severely;
‘I thought her a little free this
afternoon.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, auntie!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly, Susan! Most distinctly free.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I thought her one of the gentlest and
quietest girls I ever met,’ says Carew, who
has strolled back to them after his short
ebullition of temper—unable, indeed, to
keep away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What do you know of girls?’ says Miss
Barry scornfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m sure she’s gentle,’ says Dominick,
who is so devoted to Carew that he would
risk a great deal—even his friendship—to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>keep him out of trouble, ‘and very, very
good; because she is beyond all doubt most
femininely dull.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Pig!’ says Betty, in a whisper. She
makes a little movement towards him, and
a second later gets a pinch and a wild yell
out of him.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What I say I maintain,’ says Miss Barry
magisterially. ‘She may be a nice girl, a
gentle girl, the grandest girl that was ever
known—I’m the last in the world to depreciate
anyone—but who is she? That’s
what I want to know. And no one knows
who she is. Perhaps of the lower classes,
for all we know. And, indeed, I noticed a
few queer turns of speech. And when I
said she was free, Susan, I meant it. I
heard her distinctly call that child’—pointing
to him—‘“Tommy.” Now, if she is, as
I firmly believe—your father is a person of
no discrimination, you know—a person of a
lower grade than ourselves, didn’t it show
great freedom to do that? Yes, she distinctly
said “Tommy.”’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>‘Well, she didn’t say “Hell and Tommy,”
any way,’ says Dominick, who sometimes runs
over to London to see the theatres.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If she had,’ says Miss Barry with dignity—she
has never seen the outside of a theatre—‘I
should have had no hesitation whatsoever
in sending for the sergeant and giving her in
charge.’</p>

<p class='c010'>It is a week later, and the village is now
stirred to its depth. Such gaieties! Such
gaddings to and fro! Such wonderful tales
of what Lady Forster wore and Sir William
said, and how Miss Prior looked. Gossip is
flowing freely, delightfully, and Miss Ricketty,
whose shop is a general meeting-place, is
doing a roaring business in buns and biscuits.</p>

<p class='c004'>The Park, in fact, is full of guests.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Every corner,’ says Miss Blake to Mrs.
Hennessy, in a mysterious whisper, ‘is full
to overflowing. I hear that some of the
servants have to be accommodated outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the house, and that Mr. Crosby has painted
and papered and done up the loft over the
stables in the latest Parisian style for the
maids and valets.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My dear!’ says Mrs. Hennessy, in an
awful tone—very justly shocked; then, ‘You
forget yourself, Maria!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Faith I did,’ says Miss Blake, bursting
into an irrepressible giggle. ‘Law, how
funny y’are! But they’re safely divided,
I’m told, one at one side o’ the yard, the
other at this, as it were. Like the High
churches we hear of in England. The goats
and the sheep—ha, ha!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But where are the maids?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Over the stables at the western side, some
of them.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You don’t say so!’ says Mrs. Hennessy.
‘Bless me, but they wouldn’t like—you
know, the—er—the atmosphere!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, there’s ways of doing away with that
too,’ says Miss Blake, with a knowing air.
‘But you’ll come in for a cup of tea, won’t
you? Jane’s dyin’ to have a chat with you.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>Miss Blake is hardly to be trusted in
matters such as these, her imagination being
extraordinarily strong. And, indeed, the
idea of those stables rose alone from her
great mind. But although there are still
corners in the splendid old Hall to let, it
must be confessed that it is pretty full at
present.</p>

<p class='c004'>Guests at the Park! Such a thing had
not been heard of for many years. Not for
the last eight years, at all events.</p>

<p class='c004'>Then Crosby, who was about twenty-five,
came home from Thibet, and his sister
Katherine, who was quite a girl—being six
years his junior—had been brought over
from England by her aunt to freshen up her
old love for him, and to stay with him for
his birthday. Not longer. The birthday
came off within the week of their arriving.
Lady Melland was a woman of Society, who
hated earwigs, and early birds, and baa-lambs,
and insisted on bringing quite a big
company ‘on tour’ with her on this re-introduction
of the brother to the sister, and had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>organized a distinct rout at the Hall during
her memorable stay. It had created a fearful,
if pleasurable, impression at the time,
and people are beginning now to wonder in
this little village if Lady Forster will be a
worthy representative of her aunt. Or if
perchance the aunt will again take up the
deal; for Lady Melland has, they say, come
here with her.</p>

<p class='c004'>However, for once ‘they say’ is wrong.
Katherine Crosby had married Sir William
Forster two years after the termination of
that remarkable visit, and nothing had been
seen of her since that, until now. She had,
however, in between shaken off Lady Melland.</p>

<p class='c004'>She has brought an innumerable company
in her train, thus justifying the idea of
Curraghcloyne that she would probably
follow in her aunt’s footsteps, and, as I
have said, the village has waked to find itself
no longer deserted, but the centre of a
very brilliant crowd.</p>

<p class='c004'>Yesterday was the first of August, Saturday,
and a most unendurable one on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>small platform of the railway-station. Possibly
during its brief existence so many basket-trunks
have never been laid upon its modest
flags before. To-day is Sunday, and possibly
also the parish church has never had so large
a congregation within its whitewashed walls.
Even the Methodists, quite a large portion of
the Curraghcloyne people, have deserted their
chapel for the orthodox church. Even Miss
Ricketty has been heard to say with distinct
regret that she ‘wished she was a Protestant
for once.’</p>

<p class='c004'>The Hall pews, which number four, and
for which Mr. Crosby, during all his wanderings,
has paid carefully, are all filled, and
the three seats behind them again, that have
vacant sittings in them, are all filled also
with the servants of the people in the four
front seats. Never was there such a display
in the small church of Curraghcloyne! And
it was acknowledged afterwards by everyone
in the town that though the Rector did not
‘stir a hair,’ the curate was decidedly ‘onaisy.’
The curate was unnerved beyond a doubt.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>He grew fatter and stouter as the service
went on, and he does not know to this day
how he got through his sermon. He says
now, that people oughtn’t to spring people
on one without a word of preparation.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan tried to keep her eyes off the
Hall pews, but in spite of herself her eyes
wandered. Betty did not try to keep her
eyes off at all, so they wandered freely. She
was able, half an hour later, to tell Susan not
only the number of guests Mr. Crosby had,
but the exact colour of each gown the women
wore, and she told Susan privately that she
thought, if ever she were a rich woman, she
would never let her servants wear red ribbons
in their bonnets in church.</p>

<p class='c004'>Mr. Haldane rushes through his sermon at
the rate of an American liner, and presently
the service is over, and all move, with the
cultivated leisurely steps that are meant to
hide the desire to run, towards the open door.</p>

<p class='c004'>Some of the other Rectory people have
gone through the side-door, and, with
Bonnie’s hand fast clasped in hers, Susan is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>following after them, when a well-known
voice calls to her:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan, my sister wants very much to
know you. Will you let me introduce you
to her?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan turns her face, now delicately pink,
and she sees a small, dainty, pretty creature
holding out her hand to her with the prettiest
smile in the world.</p>

<p class='c004'>Is this Mr. Crosby’s sister?</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How d’ye do?’ says Lady Forster, in a
very clear if low voice. ‘George was chanting
your praises all last night, so naturally
I have been longing to see you. George’s
friends, as a rule, are frauds; but—’</p>

<p class='c004'>She pauses, evidently amused at the girl’s
open surprise, not so much at her words as
at her appearance.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m not a bit like George, am I?’ says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>No, she is not. Crosby is a big man, if
anything, and she is the tiniest creature.
Her features are tiny too, but exquisitely
moulded. The coquettish mouth, the nose
‘tip-tilted like a flower,’ the well-poised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>dainty head, the hands, the feet—all are
small, and her figure slender as a fairy’s.
She is wonderfully pretty in a brilliant
fashion, and her bright eyes are alight with
intelligence. She is altogether the last
person in the world Susan would have imagined
as Crosby’s sister. And yet there is
certainly a likeness between them—a strange
likeness—but, of course, his sister should
have been large and massive, not a little
thing like this. Susan has always told herself
that she should be dreadfully afraid of
his sister—but to be afraid of this sister!</p>

<p class='c004'>Lady Forster, indeed, is one of those
women who look as if they ought to be
called ‘Baby’ or ‘Birdie,’ but in reality she
was named Katherine at her birth, with a
big and a stern K, not a C—which we all
know is much milder—and never did Susan
hear her called anything less majestic by
anyone. Not even by her brother or her
husband. And this was probably because,
beneath her charming butterfly air, there lay
a good deal of character and a strength of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>will hardly to be suspected in so slight a
creature.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Susan shyly. She smiles, and
involuntarily tightens her fingers on those
she is holding—Lady Forster’s fingers.
‘But—’ A still greater shyness overcomes
her here, and she grows quite silent.
The ‘but,’ however, is eloquent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You see, George! She thinks I am infinitely
superior to you. How lovely of her!’
She laughs at Susan and pats her hand.
‘You will come up and lunch with us to-morrow,
won’t you? It is George’s birthday.
And considering the slap you have given him
just now, you can hardly refuse. It will be
a little sop to his pride, and that’s frightful!
He thinks himself a perfect joy! I’m told
that in Darkest Africa the belles—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here Crosby gives her a surreptitious
but vigorous nudge, and she breaks off her
highly-spiced and distinctly interesting, if
slightly unveracious, account of his doings in
Uganda.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’s the matter with you?’ asks she,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>whispering, of her brother, who whispers
back to her many admonitory things. She
turns again to Susan: ‘We shall expect you
to-morrow, then. It will be a charity to
enliven us, as we hardly know what to do
with ourselves, being strangers in a strange
land.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Thank you,’ says Susan faintly. How
on earth can she ever summon up courage
enough to go and lunch up there with all
these fashionable people? It is she who will
be the stranger in a strange land.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is settled then,’ says Crosby quickly.
Had he feared she would go on to say something
more—to say that she had an engagement?
‘I will call for you at twelve.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no,’ says Susan. ‘I’—confusedly—‘I
can walk up. It—it is too much trouble.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘George doesn’t think so,’ says Lady
Forster, with a faint grimace. ‘Is this
your brother?’</p>

<p class='c004'>She bends in her quick way, and turns up
Bonnie’s beautiful little face and looks at it
earnestly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>‘What a face!’ cries she. ‘Is everyone
beautiful down here? I shall come and live
here, George—no use in your putting me off!
I’m determined. It is a promise, then’—to
Susan, smiling vivaciously—‘that you will
come to-morrow, and another day. We must
arrange another day—you will bring me up
this small Adonis,’ patting Bonnie’s cheek as
he smiles at her (children love all things
pretty) ‘to see me?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I shall be very glad,’ says Susan tremulously.
Then Lady Forster trips away to
rejoin her friends, who are standing beside
the different carriages, and quarrelling gaily
as to who shall go home with whom, and for
a second Crosby is alone with Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You said it was a promise.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes,’ says Susan, ‘but—I have not known
any very—very—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Smart folk,’ says Crosby, laughing.
‘Well, you’ll know them to-morrow, and I
expect you’ll be surprised how very little
smart they are.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>‘There shan’t be a “but” in the world.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is only this’—miserably—‘that I shall
be shy, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not a bit of it. And even if you are’—he
looks at her—‘you may depend on me.
I’ll pull you through. But don’t be too
shy, Susan. Extremes are attractive things—fatally
attractive sometimes.’ He pauses.
‘Well, so much for the shyness, but what
did your “and” mean?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It meant,’ says Susan, with deep depression,
‘that they will all hate me.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I almost wish I could believe that.’ He
laughs again as he says this, and gives
Bonnie’s ear a pinch, and follows his sister.
Two minutes later, as Susan rejoins her own
people at the little gate that leads by a
short-cut to the Rectory, she sees him again,
talking gaily, and handing into one of the
carriages a tall and very handsome girl,
dressed as Susan had never seen anyone
dressed in all her life. It seems the very
perfection of dressing. She lingers a moment—a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>bare moment—but it is long enough to
see that he has seated himself beside the
handsome girl, and that he is still laughing—but
this time with her—over some reminiscence,
as the carriage drives away.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>‘I suppose I’ll have to go,’ says Susan, who
is evidently terrified at the idea, crumpling
up a small note between her fingers—a most
courteous little note sent by Lady Forster
this morning, Monday, the third of August,
to ask Miss Barry’s permission for Susan to
lunch at the Park. She—Lady Forster—had
met her charming niece yesterday, and
had induced her to promise to come to them
on this, her brother’s birthday. And she
hoped Miss Barry had not quite forgotten
her, but would remember that she was quite
an old friend, and let her come and see her
soon.</p>

<p class='c004'>It is a pretty little note, and delights Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>Barry; yet Susan finds no pleasure in it, and
now sits glum and miserable.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Go!’ cries Betty. ‘I should think so.
Oh, you lucky girl!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Would you like to go, Betty, if it were
your case?’—this wistfully. Oh that it were
Betty’s case!</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Is there anything on earth that would
keep me away?’ cries Betty enthusiastically.
‘What fun you will have there! I know by
Lady Forster’s eyes that you are safe to
have a good time. I think’—gloomily—‘she
might have asked me too.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I wish she had,’ says Susan fervently.
‘If—I had one of you with me, I should not
feel half so nervous.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What makes you nervous?’ asks Carew.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, they are all strangers, for one thing—and
besides’—rather shamefacedly—‘they
will be very big people, of course, and at
luncheon there will be entrées, and dishes,
and things I have never even heard of, and’—almost
tearfully now—‘I shan’t know what
to do.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>‘There are only two things to be remembered
really,’ says Mr. Fitzgerald slowly
but forcibly. ‘One is not to pick your teeth
with your fork, and the other is even more
important: for goodness’ sake, Susan, whatever
you do, don’t eat your peas with your
knife. All that sort of thing has gone out—has
been unfashionable for quite a year or
more.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, it’s all very well for you to make fun
of it,’ says Susan resentfully. ‘You haven’t
to go there.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And is that what you call “well for me”?
I wish I was going there, if only to look after
your manners, which evidently, by your own
account of them, leave a great deal to be
desired. By-the-by, there is one thing more
I should like to impress upon you before you
start: never, Susan—no matter how sorely
tempted—put your feet on the table-cloth.
It is quite a solecism nowadays, and—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘If you won’t go away, I shall,’ says
Susan, rising with extreme dignity. But
he leans forward, and catching the tail of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>her gown just as she is gaining her feet,
brings her with a jerk to her sitting position
again. After which they all laugh irrepressibly,
and the <i><span lang="fr">émeute</span></i> is at an end.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a lot of servants they had in
church!’ says Betty, alluding to the all-absorbing
guests at the Park. ‘I suppose
that tall woman was Lady Forster’s maid?’
‘Yes, and the little woman was Mrs.
Prior’s. By the way, that squares matters.
Mrs. Prior has grown several yards since last
year.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It seemed to me that each maid sat
behind her own mistress.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So as to keep her eye on her. And very
necessary too, no doubt.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Did you see that pale young man, ever so
thin and wretched-looking, but so conceited?
His hair was nearly down to his waist, and
he hadn’t any chin to speak of.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, that!’ cries Betty eagerly. ‘That’s
the poet. Yes, he is, Susan. He’s a real
poet. Miss Ricketty told me about him
yesterday. He has written sonnets and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>whole volumes of things, and is quite a
poet. Miss Ricketty says that’s why his
hair grows like that.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Samson must have been the laureate of
his time,’ says Dominick thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘So that was the poet,’ says Susan, who
had heard of his coming from Crosby.
‘Well, he certainly looked queer enough for
anything. I wonder’—nervously—‘who was
the tall girl sitting next to Mr. Crosby?’</p>

<p class='c004'>This was the tall girl with whom Crosby
had driven away.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t know,’ says Betty. ‘Wasn’t she
pretty? And wasn’t she beautifully dressed?
Oh, Susan, didn’t you want to see yourself
in a gown like that?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No,’ says Susan shortly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, I did. I wanted to know how I’d
look.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘As if you didn’t know,’ says Dominick
encouragingly. ‘Like Venus herself!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I never heard she had her frocks from
Paris,’ says Betty, hunching up an unkind
little shoulder against him.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>‘You’ve heard so little, you see,’ says Dom,
with gentle protest. ‘Now, as a fact, Venus
had her frocks made by—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well?’ with a threatening air.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Miss Fogerty,’ naming Betty’s own dressmaker.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Pshaw!’ says that slim damsel contemptuously.
‘However, Susan, that girl was
pretty, any way. I wonder who she was?
Had she a maid, I wonder? There was a
dark-looking woman amongst the servants
farther on, just behind the poet. Perhaps
it was hers.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no,’ says Dom gravely, ‘that was his.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘His?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The poet’s. Yes.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense!’ says Betty. ‘What would
he want a maid for?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘To comb his locks and copy his sonnets,’
says Dom, without blinking.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense! Men don’t have maids,’ says
Betty, who seems to know all about it.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, here is someone from the Park,’ cries
Jacky suddenly.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>‘Is it Mr. Crosby or Lady Forster?’ asks
Susan anxiously.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Both of ’em,’ says Jacky, in his own
sweet laconic style.</p>

<p class='c004'>The smart little cart, with its wonderful
pair of ponies, rattled up to the door, and
Miss Barry, who had known that someone
would come to fetch Susan, and had therefore
put on her best bib and tucker, emerged from
the flower-crowned porch of the Rectory to
receive Lady Forster, her old face wreathed
in smiles. It was sweet to her to see Susan
accepted and admired by the Park people.
‘Our own sort of people’ proudly thought
the poor old maid, who had struggled with
much poverty all her life.</p>

<p class='c004'>And Lady Forster was quite charming to
her, insisting on going to see the old garden
again, ‘which she quite remembered.’ Lady
Forster had never stuck at a tarradiddle or
two, and was, after seeing it, genuinely
enthusiastic over its old-fashioned charms.
Might she bring her friends to see it? They
had never, never seen anything so lovely!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>It would be a charity to show them something
human, these benighted town-people.
To hear her, one would imagine she despised
the town herself, whereas, as a fact, she could
never live for six months out of it.</p>

<p class='c004'>Miss Barry was elated—so elated, indeed,
that she took a dreadful step. She invited
Lady Forster and all her friends to tea
the next Friday, without a thought as to
the consequences—until afterwards! Lady
Forster accepted the invitation with effusion.
There was no getting out of it, Miss Barry
felt during that dreadful ‘afterwards.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Meantime Susan had found herself, comparatively
speaking, alone with Crosby, when
she came downstairs after putting on her best
gown and hat. She had brought something
with her besides the best gown and hat; a
little silken bag, made out of a bit of lovely
old brocade she had begged from Miss Barry
a month ago. She had cut it out, and
stitched it, and filled it with lavender-seeds,
and worked on it at odd moments when no
one but Betty could see her (she was afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>of the boys’ jokes) the words: ‘Mr. Crosby,
from Susan.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At first she had thought of buying something
for him—something at Miss Ricketty’s,
who really had, at times, quite wonderful
things down from Dublin, but her soul revolted
from that. What could she buy him
that he would care for? And besides, to
buy a thing for a person one liked, and one
who had been so good to Bonnie! No; she
could not. It seemed cold, unkind. So she
decided on the little bag that was to lie in
his drawer and perfume his handkerchiefs,
and tell him sometimes of her—yes, her
love for him! Because she did love him, if
only for his goodness to the children, and to
her Bonnie first of all.</p>

<p class='c004'>She had been afraid to run the gauntlet of
the boys’ criticisms, but Betty she clung to.
A confidante one must have sometimes, or
die.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You know he told me, Betty, when his
birthday would be.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes. So clever of him!’ said Betty, who,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>if she were at the point of death, could not
have refrained from a joke.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, he has been good to the chicks,
hasn’t he? To darling Bonnie especially.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, he has—he has indeed,’ Betty declared
remorsefully, melting at the thought
of the little crippled brother who is so inexpressibly
dear to them all.</p>

<hr class='c012'>

<p class='c004'>Betty had hurried up with Susan to get
her into her best things, and then had given
her sound advice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Give it to him now, Susan. Lady
Forster’—glancing out of the window—‘is
talking to Aunt Jemima. Hurry down and
give it to him at once. It is the sweetest
bag. No one’—giggling—‘can say less
than that for it. It’s quite crammed with
lavender.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, I will,’ says Susan valiantly.</p>

<p class='c004'>She doesn’t, however. She hesitates, and
is, as usual, lost. She tries and tries to take
that little bag out of her pocket and give
it to him, but her courage fails her. And
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>presently Lady Forster carries her off, and
now the Park is reached, and she finds herself
in the lovely, sunny drawing-room, and
after a while in the dining-room, and still
that little fragrant bag lies perdu.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan glances shyly round her. Sir
William Forster, a tall young man with a
kindly eye, takes her fancy at once, and
there is a big girl over there and a big
woman here (they must be mother and
daughter), who make her wonder a great
deal about their strange garments. Mrs.
Prior is here, too, and Miss Prior—Mr.
Wyndham’s people. And at the opposite
side of the table Mr. Wyndham himself.
Beside him sits the poet, a lachrymose young
man with long hair and a crooked eye, and
the name of Jones. No wonder he looks
depressed!</p>

<p class='c004'>He has got his best eye fixed immovably
on Susan, who seems to appeal even to his
high ideal of beauty—and, indeed, throughout
the day she suffers a good deal, off
and on, from his unspoken, but quite open,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>adoration of her. Poets never admire: they
adore. And for a simple country maiden
this style is somewhat embarrassing. On
Mr. Crosby’s right hand is sitting the tall
and beautiful girl, with the pale roses near
her throat, with whom he had driven home
from church on Sunday. It seems all quite
clear to Susan. Yes, this is the girl he is
going to marry. But a girl so beautiful as
that could make anyone happy. She had
heard someone call her Lady Muriel. Rank
and beauty and sweetness—all are for him.
And surely he deserves them all; and that
is why she is at his right hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Susan is seated beside a very fashionably-dressed
girl with an extremely good-humoured
face, and Captain Lennox—a man of about
thirty or thereabouts—who seems to find
pleasure in an every two minutes’ contemplation
of her young and charming face. In
this, the good-humoured looking girl—Miss
Forbes—is not a whit behind Captain Lennox,
she too seeming to be delighted with Susan.
And, indeed, everyone seems to have fallen
in love with pretty Susan, for presently the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>stately young beauty sitting next to Crosby,
who has come in a little late for luncheon,
whispers something to him, and then looks
smilingly at Susan. Crosby, in answer to
her words, says quietly:</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan—Lady Muriel Kennedy is very
anxious to know you. Miss Barry, Lady
Muriel.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I went past your charming old home
yesterday,’ says Lady Muriel, in tones barely
above a whisper, but which seem to carry a
long distance. ‘I quite wanted to go in, but
I was afraid.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Well, you’ll be able to satiate your curiosity
on Friday,’ says Lady Forster, ‘as we
have been asked to tea on that day at the
Rectory.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How delightful!’ says Lady Muriel.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Your house is quite close to the Cottage,
is it not, Miss Barry?’ asks Mrs. Prior.
‘My nephew’s place, you know’—nodding at
Wyndham, who changes colour perceptibly.
Good heavens! what is going to happen
next?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>‘Yes,’ says Susan; ‘only the road divides
us.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Then you can tell us about Mr. Wyndham’s
new tenant. You’—smiling archly—‘are
quite an old friend of my nephew’s, eh?’
It is quite safe to make a jest of the friendship
with this insignificant little country girl,
as, of course, Paul, or any other man of consequence,
would not waste a thought over her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Almost, indeed,’ says Susan. ‘But as to
the tenant—’</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby drops a spoon, and Susan, a little
startled, turns her head. It is not on him,
however, her eyes rest, but on Wyndham,
who is looking at her with a strange expression.
Is it imploring, despairing, or
what? It checks her, at all events.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I know very little,’ she murmurs faintly.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Been flirting with him,’ thinks Mrs. Prior
promptly. ‘All country girls are so vulgar.
Any new man.... And I dare say this tenant
of Paul’s is by no means a nice man either.’</p>

<p class='c004'>There might have been a slight awkwardness
here, but providentially Lady Forster,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>who is never silent for two minutes together,
breaks into the gap.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What’s this, George?’ asks she, peering
into a dish before her. ‘Are you prepared
to guarantee it? It’s your cook, you know,
not mine. Looks dangerous, and therefore
tempting; and any way, one can only die
once. Oh! is that you?’—to a late man
who has strolled in. ‘Been losing yourself
as usual? Come over here and sit beside
me, you innocent lamb’—patting the empty
chair near her—‘and I’ll look after you. I’ll
give you one of these’—pointing to the dish—‘I
hate to die alone. What on earth are
they?’—glancing at the little brown curled-up
things that seem filled with burnt crumbs.
‘Will they go off, George? Bombs, eh?’</p>

<p class='c004'>Here the butler murmurs something to her
in a discreet tone.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, mushrooms! Good gracious, then
why don’t they try to look like them!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Have you any brothers?’ asks Miss
Forbes, turning to Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t answer,’ says Captain Lennox.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>‘She’s always asking after one’s brothers. Tell
me, instead, how many sisters you have. Much
more interesting. I love people’s sisters.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I’m George’s sister,’ says Lady Forster,
glancing at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘And my wife!’ says Sir William, with
such an over-assumption of marital authority
that they all laugh, and his wife throws a
pellet of bread at him.</p>

<p class='c004'>Susan grows thoughtful, filled with a
slight amazement. She had been nervous,
almost distressed, at the idea of having to
lunch at the Park. Its habitués, she told
herself, would be very grand folk, and clever,
and learned, and would talk very far above
her little countrified head. And now how is
it? Why, after all, they are more like Dom
in his queerest moods than anything else.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What shall we do after luncheon?’ says
Lady Forster. ‘I am willing to chaperon
anybody.’ She glances at Lady Muriel, and
Susan intercepts the glance.</p>

<p class='c004'>Is it Lady Muriel and Mr. Crosby she is
thinking of chaperoning?</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>‘Oh, I like your idea of supervision,’ says
the Guardsman who has come in late, and
who is called Lord Jack by everybody, only
because, as Susan discovers afterwards, his
name is Jack Lord. This, naturally, is inevitable.
‘You once undertook to chaperon
me, and let me in for about the most <i><span lang="fr">risqué</span></i>
situation of my life. I came out of it barely
alive, and very nearly maimed.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes—I don’t think Katherine would make
a very excellent chaperon,’ says Mrs. Prior,
who likes Crosby, but cordially detests his
sister.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What a slander!’ cries Lady Forster;
‘easy to see you don’t understand me! I’m
a splendid chaperon—a born one. Always
half a mile ahead—or else in the rear. One
should always be ahead if possible, as it gives
the poor creatures a chance of getting up to
you in an honourable way, if the enemy
should come in sight. Whereas the turning
and running back business always looks so
bad. No, better be in front of them. I’m
going to write a little treatise on the art
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>of chaperoning for all right-minded married
women—and I hope you will accept a copy,
dear Mrs. Prior.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I don’t expect I shall get one,’ says Mrs.
Prior, with a distinct sneer.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh, you shall indeed, “honest Injun,”’
says Lady Forster. ‘You’ll be delighted
with it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I feel sure of that,’ says Captain Lennox
in an aside to Miss Forbes.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘But really what shall we do this afternoon,
George?’ asks his sister; ‘ride—drive?’
She has left her seat, and has perched herself
on the arm of the handsome old chair in
which her husband is sitting at the foot of
the table.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What about the Abbey, Bill?’ asks
Crosby, addressing his brother-in-law.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No use in asking “Billee Barlow” anything,’
says that young man’s wife. ‘He
hasn’t an idea on earth. Have you, Billee?
And the Abbey is miles off, and— Do
you ride, Susan? I am going to call you
Susan, if I may.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>She pauses just long enough to give Susan
time to smile a pleased, if shy, assent.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan is so pretty,’ says Captain Lennox
absently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Eh?’ says Crosby quickly, and with a
suspicion of a frown.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Very, very pretty,’ repeats Lennox
fervently.</p>

<p class='c004'>Crosby glances at Susan. This absurd
joke, this jest on her name—with anyone
else here it would be a jest only, but Susan—would
she.... Her colour is faintly, very
faintly accentuated, and she is looking
straight at Lennox.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My name?’ says she, taking up the
meaning he had not meant. ‘Do you really
think it pretty? The boys and Betty despise
it.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Her gentle dignity goes home to all.
Crosby is indignant with Lennox, and, indeed,
so is Sir William. Sir William’s wife,
however, I regret to say, is convulsed with
laughter.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It is certainly not a name to be despised,’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>says Lennox courteously, who is now a little
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I like to be called by my Christian name,’
says a singularly young-looking married
woman. ‘Puts people out so. They never
know whether you are married or not for the
first half-hour, at all events.’</p>

<p class='c004'>They are now in a body strolling into the
drawing-rooms, and Miss Forbes has gone
back to her cross-examination of Susan.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Four brothers? So many? And all
grown up?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no! Carew is the eldest, and he is
only seventeen. But we have a cousin living
with us, and he is twenty.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What lovely ages!’ cries Lady Forster.
‘George, why didn’t you tell me about
Susan’s boys? You know I adore boys.
Susan, you must bring them up to-morrow.
Do you hear?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They will be so glad,’ says Susan; ‘do
you know’—blushing shyly and divinely—‘they
were quite envious of me because I
was coming here to-day.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>‘Oh! why didn’t you bring them with you?
Seventeen and twenty—the nicest ages in the
world!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly not the nicest,’ says Lennox,
who is a born tease. ‘You, Miss Barry’—looking
at Susan—‘are thirteen, aren’t you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no; much, much more than that!’
says Susan, laughing. Strangely enough,
she has begun to feel quite a liking for her
tormentor, divining with the wisdom of
youth that his saucy sallies are filled with
mischief only, and no venom. ‘I was
eighteen last May.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘How very candid!’ says Miss Prior, whose
own age is growing uncertain, and who is
feeling a little bitter over the attention paid
to Susan. If Paul should prove inconstant,
there is always the master of the Park to
fall back upon, or so she has fondly hoped
till now. But there is no denying the fact
that Crosby has been very anxious all this
afternoon about Susan’s happiness.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Nonsense!’ says Lennox. ‘Tell that to—well,
to somebody else.’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>‘But that’s what I am really,’ says Susan,
who is secretly disgusted at being thought
thirteen. ‘I was born in—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Don’t tell that,’ says Lady Forster,
putting up her finger. ‘It will be fatal
twenty years hence.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Still, I’m not thirteen,’ says Susan, with
gentle protest. ‘And I think anyone could
see that I’m not.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I could, certainly,’ says Crosby, coming
to the rescue. ‘In my opinion, anyone that
looked at you would know at once that you
were forty.’</p>

<p class='c004'>At this they laugh, and Susan casts her
so very unusual ire behind her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You will bring up the boys to-morrow,
then?’ says Lady Forster, who is always
chattering. ‘And we’ll go for a long drive,
and have a gipsy tea. That will be better
than nothing. And as we go Susan shall
show us the bits. No use in depending on
George for that. He knows nothing of the
scenery round here, or any other scenery for
the matter of that, except African interiors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>kraals, and nasty naked nigger women, and
that. So immodest of him! He’ll come to
grief some day. We can go somewhere for
a gipsy tea to-morrow, can’t we, George?
I’m dying to light a fire.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘What, another!’ says Lord Jack, regarding
her with a would-be woe-begone air. He
lays his hand lightly on his heart.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It’s going to rain, I think,’ says Sir
William presently; he is standing in one
of the windows.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘“Ruin seize thee, ruthless king!”’ exclaims
Miss Forbes. ‘What a thing to say!’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘It always rains in Ireland, doesn’t it?’
asks Lady Muriel, in her soft, low voice.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Oh no—no indeed!’ cries Susan eagerly.
‘Does it, Mr. Crosby?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Certainly not. Lady Muriel must prolong
her stay here’—smiling at the beautiful girl
leaning in a picturesque attitude against the
window-shutter—‘and take back with her a
more kindly view of our climate.’</p>

<p class='c004'>Yes; it is quite settled, thinks Susan. He
loves her, and she—of course she loves him.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>And he wants her to prolong her stay, most
naturally. And most naturally, too, he would
like her to take back to England a kindly
impression of her future home, of her future
climate. Oh, how pretty, how lovely she is!</p>

<p class='c004'>Heavily, heavily beat the raindrops on the
window-pane.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Never mind,’ says Lady Forster, whom
nothing daunts; ‘we’ll have a dance. You
love dancing, Susan, don’t you? Come
along, then. Take your partners all, and
let’s waltz into the music-room.’</p>

<p class='c004'>In a second Susan finds Captain Lennox’s
arm round her waist, and through the halls
and the library they dance right into the
music-room beyond. After her comes Crosby
with Lady Muriel, and after them Lady
Forster with—no, not Lord Jack, after all,
but Sir William.</p>

<p class='c004'>And now the big woman whom Susan had
noticed at luncheon has seated herself at the
piano, and the poet has caught up a fiddle,
and if the big woman can do nothing else
on earth, she can at least play dance music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>to perfection, and the poet, ‘poor little fellow,’
as Susan calls him to herself—if he could
only have heard her!—does not make too
many false notes on the fiddle, so that she
dances very gaily, feeling as if her feet
are treading on air, and answering Captain
Lennox’s whispered honeyed words with soft
smiles and hurried breathing. Oh, how
lovely it all is! And, oh, how happy Lady
Muriel is going to be!</p>

<p class='c004'>The waltz has come to an end, and now
Crosby is standing before her. And now his
arm is round her waist, and he—oh yes, there
is no doubt of it—he dances even better than
Captain Lennox, and it is good of him, too,
to spare so much time from the lovely Lady
Muriel.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Susan,’ says Crosby, as they pause at the
end of the room, ‘I consider your conduct
distinctly immoral! The way you have been
going on—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Who—I?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes, you! Don’t attempt to deny it.
Your open flirtation with Lennox—’</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>‘What?’ Susan lifts her dewy eyes to
his. Suddenly she breaks into the merriest
laughter. ‘You’re too funny for anything,’
says she.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Not for another dance, I hope.’ He
laughs too, and so gaily. And again his
arm is round her, and away they go once
more, dancing to the big lady’s happiest
strains. There is a conservatory off the
music-room, and into this he leads her
presently.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘You have no flowers,’ says he. ‘I must
give you some. These roses will suit you.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘They suit Lady Muriel too,’ says Susan,
remembering.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Yes? Oh yes! I gave them to her this
morning. Well, it shan’t be roses, then.
These pink begonias?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I should like those better,’ says Susan;
she takes them tranquilly. It is, of course,
quite right that he should wish to give her
flowers different from those he has just given
his <i><span lang="fr">fiancée</span></i>. She had reminded him just in
time.</p>

<p class='c004'><span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>Crosby is thankful for her suggestion, but
for very different reasons. He had forgotten
about Lady Muriel’s roses, and to give her
the same—</p>

<p class='c004'>‘The rain is clearing away,’ says he, looking
out of the window. ‘Still’—as if to
himself—‘I think we had better take an
umbrella.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘An umbrella?’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘On our way home.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Mr. Crosby’—eagerly—‘you need not
take me home. You must not. There is
really no necessity. Oh!’—anxiously, thinking
of Lady Muriel and his desire to be with
her—‘I hope you won’t come.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘That is not very civil, Susan, is it?’ says
he, smiling. He pauses and looks suddenly
at her, a new expression growing in his eyes.
‘Of course, if you have arranged to go home
with anyone else—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘No—no indeed. But to take you away
from your guests—’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘My guests will live without me for half
an hour, I have no doubt.’ His tone is quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>its old joyous self again. ‘And I promised
your aunt to see that you got safely back to
her, and, as the children say, “a promise is a
promise.” Here are your begonias. Shall I
fasten them in for you?’</p>

<p class='c004'>He arranges them under her pretty chin,
she holding up her head to let him do it, and
then they go back to the music-room, where
Sir William catches him and carries him off
for something or other. Susan, sinking into
a chair, finds Josephine Prior almost immediately
beside her.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘Those pretty begonias!’ says she. ‘How
they suit you, though hardly your frock!
Of course’—with elephantine archness—‘I
need not ask who gave them to you. Mr.
Crosby is always showering little favours on
his women friends. Those roses to Lady
Muriel’—Susan holds her breath a moment—‘and
these begonias to you, and opera-tickets
to others, and last night such a delicious
box of <i><span lang="fr">marron glaces</span></i> to me.’ She
forgets to add that he gave a similar box
to each of his lady guests, having run up to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Dublin in the morning and brought them
back with him from Mitchell’s.</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I declare the sun is coming out at last,’
says Lady Forster. ‘It is going to be a
glorious evening. What a swindle! We
have been quite done out of our day. I do
call that maddening. Never mind, we must
make up for it to-night. We will have—what
shall we have, Dolly?’—to Miss Forbes.
‘A pillow scuffle? Yes; that will be the
very thing. And, Susan, you shall stay and
sleep and help us. And we’ll get the boys
up. They would be splendid at it, and give
even us points, I shouldn’t wonder.’</p>

<p class='c004'>‘I have promised Miss Barry,’ says Crosby,
in a distinct tone, ‘to take Susan home this
evening at six, and I’m afraid it is rather
after that now. Will you go and put on
your hat, Susan?’</p>

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a

by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this

electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
